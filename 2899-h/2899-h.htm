      <span class="smcap">Rapid</span> 
			growth accompanied by a somewhat painful readjustment has been one
      of the leading characteristics of the history of the United States during
      the last half century. In the West the change has been so swift and
      spectacular as to approach a complete metamorphosis. With the passing of
      the frontier has gone something of the old freedom and the old
      opportunity; and the inevitable change has brought forth inevitable
      protest, particularly from the agricultural class. Simple farming
      communities have wakened to find themselves complex industrial regions in
      which the farmers have frequently lost their former preferred position.
      The result has been a series of radical agitations on the part of farmers
      determined to better their lot. These movements have manifested different
      degrees of coherence and intelligence, but all have had something of the
      same purpose and spirit, and all may justly be considered as stages of the
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
      still unfinished agrarian crusade. This book is an attempt to sketch the
      course and to reproduce the spirit of that crusade from its inception with
      the Granger movement, through the Greenback and Populist phases, to a
      climax in the battle for free silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the preparation of the chapters dealing with Populism I received
      invaluable assistance from my colleague, Professor Lester B. Shippee of
      the University of Minnesota; and I am indebted to my wife for aid at every
      stage of the work, especially in the revision of the manuscript.

    <p class="noindent">
      <span class="smcap">When</span> 
			President Johnson authorized the Commissioner of Agriculture, in
      1866, to send a clerk in his bureau on a trip through the Southern States
      to procure "statistical and other information from those States," he could
      scarcely have foreseen that this trip would lead to a movement among the
      farmers, which, in varying forms, would affect the political and economic
      life of the nation for half a century. The clerk selected for this
      mission, one Oliver Hudson Kelley, was something more than a mere
      collector of data and compiler of statistics: he was a keen observer and a
      thinker. Kelley was born in Boston of a good Yankee family that could
      boast kinship with Oliver Wendell Holmes and Judge Samuel Sewall. At the
      age of twenty-three 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_002" id="Page_002">2</a></span> 
			he journeyed to Iowa, where he married. Then with his
      wife he went on to Minnesota, settled in Elk River Township, and acquired
      some first-hand familiarity with agriculture. At the time of Kelley's
      service in the agricultural bureau he was forty years old, a man of
      dignified presence, with a full beard already turning white, the high
      broad forehead of a philosopher, and the eager eyes of an enthusiast. "An
      engine with too much steam on all the time"&mdash;so one of his friends
      characterized him; and the abnormal energy which he displayed on the trip
      through the South justifies the figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kelley had had enough practical experience in agriculture to be
      sympathetically aware of the difficulties of farm life in the period
      immediately following the Civil War. Looking at the Southern farmers not
      as a hostile Northerner would but as a fellow agriculturist, he was struck
      with the distressing conditions which prevailed. It was not merely the
      farmers' economic difficulties which he noticed, for such difficulties
      were to be expected in the South in the adjustment after the great
      conflict; it was rather their blind disposition to do as their
      grandfathers had done, their antiquated methods of agriculture, and, most
      of all, their apathy. Pondering on this attitude, Kelley decided that it
      was fostered 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_003" id="Page_003">3</a></span> 
			if not caused by the lack of social opportunities which made
      the existence of the farmer such a drear monotony that he became
      practically incapable of changing his outlook on life or his attitude
      toward his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being essentially a man of action, Kelley did not stop with the mere
      observation of these evils but cast about to find a remedy. In doing so,
      he came to the conclusion that a national secret order of farmers
      resembling the Masonic order, of which he was a member, might serve to
      bind the farmers together for purposes of social and intellectual
      advancement. After he returned from the South, Kelley discussed the plan
      in Boston with his niece, Miss Carrie Hall, who argued quite sensibly that
      women should be admitted to full membership in the order, if it was to
      accomplish the desired ends. Kelley accepted her suggestion and went West
      to spend the summer in farming and dreaming of his project. The next year
      found him again in Washington, but this time as a clerk in the Post Office
      Department.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the summer and fall of 1867 Kelley interested some of his
      associates in his scheme. As a result seven men&mdash;"one fruit grower
      and six government clerks, equally distributed among the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_004" id="Page_004">4</a></span> 
			Post Office, Treasury, and Agricultural Departments"&mdash;are usually 
			recognized as the founders of the Patrons of Husbandry, or, as the order 
			is more commonly called, the Grange. These men, all of whom but one had 
			been born on farms, were O.&nbsp;H. Kelley and W.&nbsp;M. Ireland of the 
			Post Office Department, William Saunders and the Reverend A.&nbsp;B. 
			Grosh of the Agricultural Bureau, the Reverend John Trimble and J.&nbsp;R. 
			Thompson of the Treasury Department, and F.&nbsp;M. McDowell, a pomologist 
			of Wayne, New York. Kelley and Ireland planned a ritual for the society; 
			Saunders interested a few farmers at a meeting of the United States 
			Pomological Society in St. Louis in August, and secured the 
			co&ouml;peration of McDowell; the other men helped these four in 
			corresponding with interested farmers and in perfecting the ritual. On 
			December 4, 1867, having framed a constitution and adopted the motto 
			<i>Esto perpetua</i>, they met and constituted themselves the National 
			Grange of the Patrons of Husbandry. Saunders was to be Master; 
			Thompson, Lecturer; Ireland, Treasurer; and Kelley, Secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is interesting to note, in view of the subsequent political activity in
      which the movement for agricultural organization became inevitably
      involved, that the founders of the Grange looked for 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_005" id="Page_005">5</a></span> 
			advantages to come to the farmer through intellectual and social 
			intercourse, not through political action. Their purpose was "the 
			advancement of agriculture," but they expected that advancement to be an 
			educative rather than a legislative process. It was to that end, for 
			instance, that they provided for a Grange "Lecturer," a man whose business 
			it was to prepare for each meeting a program apart from the prescribed 
			ritual&mdash;perhaps a paper read by one of the members or an address by a 
			visiting speaker. With this plan for social and intellectual advancement, 
			then, the founders of the Grange set out to gain members.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the first four years the order grew slowly, partly because of the
      mistakes of the founders, partly because of the innate conservatism and
      suspicion of the average farmer. The first local Grange was organized in
      Washington. It was made up largely of government clerks and their wives
      and served less to advance the cause of agriculture than to test the
      ritual. In February, 1868, Kelley resigned his clerkship in the Post
      Office Department and turned his whole attention to the organization of
      the new order. His colleagues, in optimism or irony, voted him a salary of
      two thousand dollars a year and traveling expenses, to be paid from the
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_006" id="Page_006">6</a></span> 
      receipts of any subordinate Granges he should establish. Thus authorized,
      Kelley bought a ticket for Harrisburg, and with two dollars and a half in
      his pocket, started out to work his way to Minnesota by organizing
      Granges. On his way out he sold four dispensations for the establishment
      of branch organizations&mdash;three for Granges in Harrisburg, Columbus,
      and Chicago, which came to nothing, and one for a Grange in Fredonia, New
      York, which was the first regular, active, and permanent local
      organization. This, it is important to note, was established as a result
      of correspondence with a farmer of that place, and in by far the smallest
      town of the four. Kelley seems at first to have made the mistake of
      attempting to establish the order in the large cities, where it had no
      native soil in which to grow.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Kelley revised his plan and began to work from his farm in Minnesota
      and among neighbors whose main interest was in agriculture, he was more
      successful. His progress was not, however, so marked as to insure his
      salary and expenses; in fact, the whole history of these early years
      represents the hardest kind of struggle against financial difficulties.
      Later, Kelley wrote of this difficult period: "If all great enterprises,
      to be permanent, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_007" id="Page_007">7</a></span> 
			must necessarily start from small beginnings, our Order is all right. Its 
			foundation was laid on <em>solid nothing</em>&mdash;the rock of
      poverty&mdash;and there is no harder material." At times the persistent
      secretary found himself unable even to buy postage for his circular
      letters. His friends at Washington began to lose interest in the work of
      an order with a treasury "so empty that a five-cent stamp would need an
      introduction before it would feel at home in it." Their only letters to
      Kelley during this trying time were written to remind him of bills owed by
      the order. The total debt was not more than $150, yet neither the
      Washington members nor Kelley could find funds to liquidate it. "My dear
      brother," wrote Kelley to Ireland, "you must not swear when the printer
      comes in.&hellip; When they come in to 'dun' ask them to take a seat; light
      your pipe; lean back in a chair, and suggest to them that some plan be
      adopted to bring in ten or twenty members, and thus furnish funds to pay
      their bills." A note of $39, in the hands of one Mr. Bean, caused the
      members in Washington further embarrassment at this time and occasioned a
      gleam of humor in one of Kelley's letters. Bean's calling on the men at
      Washington, he wrote, at least reminded them of the absentee, and to be
      cursed by an old 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_008" id="Page_008">8</a></span> 
			friend was better than to be forgotten. "I suggest," he continued, "that 
			Granges use black and white <em>Beans</em> for ballots."
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of all his difficulties, Kelley stubbornly continued his endeavor
      and kept up the fiction of a powerful central order at the capital by
      circulating photographs of the founders and letters which spoke in glowing
      terms of the great national organization of the Patrons of Husbandry. "It
      must be advertised as vigorously as if it were a patent medicine," he
      said; and to that end he wrote articles for leading agricultural papers,
      persuaded them to publish the constitution of the Grange, and inserted
      from time to time press notices which kept the organization before the
      public eye. In May, 1868, came the first fruits of all this correspondence
      and advertisement&mdash;the establishment of a Grange at Newton, Iowa. In
      September, the first permanent Grange in Minnesota, the North Star Grange,
      was established at St. Paul with the assistance of Colonel D.&nbsp;A.
      Robertson. This gentleman and his associates interested themselves in
      spreading the order. They revised the Grange circulars to appeal to the
      farmer's pocketbook, emphasizing the fact that the order offered a means
      of protection against corporations and opportunities for co&ouml;perative
      buying and 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_009" id="Page_009">9</a></span> 
			selling. This practical appeal was more effective than the
      previous idealistic propaganda: two additional Granges were established
      before the end of the year; a state Grange was constituted early in the
      next year; and by the end of 1869 there were in Minnesota thirty-seven
      active Granges. In the spring of 1869 Kelley went East and, after visiting
      the thriving Grange in Fredonia, he made his report at Washington to the
      members of the National Grange, who listened perfunctorily, passed a few
      laws, and relapsed into indifference after this first regular annual
      session.
    </p>
    <p>
      But however indifferent the members of the National Grange might be as to
      the fate of the organization they had so irresponsibly fathered, Kelley
      was zealous and untiring in its behalf. That the founders did not deny
      their parenthood was enough for him; he returned to his home with high
      hopes for the future. With the aid of his niece he carried on an
      indefatigable correspondence which soon brought tangible returns. In
      October, 1870, Kelley moved his headquarters to Washington. By the end of
      the year the Order had penetrated nine States of the Union, and
      correspondence looking to its establishment in seven more States was well
      under way. Though Granges had been planted as 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_010" id="Page_010">10</a></span> 
			far east as Vermont and New
      Jersey and as far south as Mississippi and South Carolina, the life of the
      order as yet centered in Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, and
      Indiana. These were the only States in which, in its four years of
      activity the Grange had really taken root; in other States only sporadic
      local Granges sprang up. The method of organization, however, had been
      found and tested. When a few active subordinate Granges had been
      established in a State, they convened as a temporary state Grange, the
      master of which appointed deputies to organize other subordinate Granges
      throughout the State. The initiation fees, generally three dollars for men
      and fifty cents for women, paid the expenses of organization&mdash;fifteen
      dollars to the deputy, and not infrequently a small sum to the state
      Grange. What was left went into the treasury of the local Grange. Thus by
      the end of 1871 the ways and means of spreading the Grange had been
      devised. All that was now needed was some impelling motive which should
      urge the farmers to enter and support the organization.

    <p class="chaptertitle">The Rising Spirit of Unrest</p>
	
    <p class="noindent">
      <span class="smcap">The</span> 
			decade of the seventies witnessed the subsidence, if not the solution,
      of a problem which had vexed American history for half a century&mdash;the
      reconciliation of two incompatible social and economic systems, the North
      and the South. It witnessed at the same time the rise of another great
      problem, even yet unsolved&mdash;the preservation of equality of
      opportunity, of democracy, economic as well as political, in the face of
      the rising power and influence of great accumulations and combinations of
      wealth. Almost before the battle smoke of the Civil War had rolled away,
      dissatisfaction with prevailing conditions both political and economic
      began to show itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The close of the war naturally found the Republican or Union party in
      control throughout the North. Branded with the opprobrium of having
      opposed the conduct of the war, the Democratic 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_012" id="Page_012">12</a></span>
			party remained impotent for
      a number of years; and Ulysses S. Grant, the nation's greatest military
      hero, was easily elected to the presidency on the Republican ticket in
      1868. In the latter part of Grant's first term, however, hostility began
      to manifest itself among the Republicans themselves toward the politicians
      in control at Washington. Several causes tended to alienate from the
      President and his advisers the sympathies of many of the less partisan and
      less prejudiced Republicans throughout the North. Charges of corruption
      and maladministration were rife and had much foundation in truth. Even if
      Grant himself was not consciously dishonest in his application of the
      spoils system and in his willingness to receive reward in return for
      political favors, he certainly can be justly charged with the disposition
      to trust too blindly in his friends and to choose men for public office
      rather because of his personal preferences than because of their
      qualifications for positions of trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grant's enemies declared, moreover, with considerable truth that the man
      was a military autocrat, unfit for the highest civil position in a
      democracy. His high-handed policy in respect to Reconstruction in the
      South evoked opposition from those
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_013" id="Page_013">13</a></span>
      Northern Republicans whose critical sense was not entirely blinded by
      sectional prejudice and passion. The keener-sighted of the Northerners
      began to suspect that Reconstruction in the South often amounted to little
      more than the looting of the governments of the Southern States by the
      greedy freedmen and the unscrupulous carpetbaggers, with the troops of the
      United States standing by to protect the looters. In 1871, under color of
      necessity arising from the intimidation of voters in a few sections of the
      South, Congress passed a stringent act, empowering the President to
      suspend the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> and to use the military at any 
			time to suppress disturbances or attempts to intimidate voters. This act, 
			in the hands of radicals, gave the carpetbag governments of the Southern 
			States practically unlimited powers. Any citizens who worked against the 
			existing administrations, however peacefully, might be charged with 
			intimidation of voters and prosecuted under the new act. Thus these 
			radical governments were made practically self-perpetuating. When their 
			corruption, wastefulness, and inefficiency became evident, many people in 
			the North frankly condemned them and the Federal Government which 
			continued to support them.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_014" id="Page_014">14</a></span>
      This dissatisfaction with the Administration on the part of Republicans
      and independents came to a head in 1872 in the Liberal-Republican
      movement. As early as 1870 a group of Republicans in Missouri, disgusted
      by the excesses of the radicals in that State in the proscription of
      former Confederate sympathizers, had led a bolt from the party, had
      nominated B. Gratz Brown for governor, and, with the assistance of the
      Democrats, had won the election. The real leader of this movement was
      Senator Carl Schurz, under whose influence the new party in Missouri
      declared not only for the removal of political disabilities but also for
      tariff revision and civil service reform and manifested opposition to the
      alienation of the public domain to private corporations and to all schemes
      for the repudiation of any part of the national debt. Similar splits in
      the Republican party took place soon afterwards in other States, and in
      1872 the Missouri Liberals called a convention to meet at Cincinnati for
      the purpose of nominating a candidate for the presidency.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new party was a coalition of rather diverse elements. Prominent tariff
      reformers, members of the Free Trade League, such as David A. Wells and
      Edward L. Godkin of the <i>Nation</i>, advocates of civil 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_015" id="Page_015">15</a></span>
			service reform, of whom Carl Schurz was a leading representative, and 
			especially opponents of the reconstruction measures of the Administration, 
			such as Judge David Davis and Horace Greeley, saw an opportunity to 
			promote their favorite policies through this new party organization. To 
			these sincere reformers were soon added such disgruntled politicians as 
			A.&nbsp;G. Curtin of Pennsylvania and R.&nbsp;E. Fenton of New York, who 
			sought revenge for the support which the Administration had given to their 
			personal rivals. The principal bond of union was the common desire to 
			prevent the re&euml;lection of Grant. The platform adopted by the 
			Cincinnati convention reflected the composition of the party. Opening 
			with a bitter denunciation of the President, it declared in no uncertain 
			terms for civil service reform and the immediate and complete removal of 
			political disabilities. On the tariff, however, the party could come to no 
			agreement; the free traders were unable to overcome the opposition of 
			Horace Greeley and his protectionist followers; and the outcome was the 
			reference of the question "to the people in their congressional districts 
			and the decision of Congress."
    </p>
    <p>
      The leading candidates for nomination for the presidency were Charles
      Francis Adams, David 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_016" id="Page_016">16</a></span>
			Davis, Horace Greeley, Lyman Trumbull, and B. Gratz
      Brown. From these men, as a result of manipulation, the convention
      unhappily selected the one least suited to lead the party to 
			victory&mdash;Horace Greeley. The only hope of success for the movement 
			was in co&ouml;peration with that very Democratic party whose principles, 
			policies, and leaders, Greeley in his editorials had unsparingly condemned 
			for years. His extreme protectionism repelled not only the Democrats but 
			the tariff reformers who had played an important part in the organization 
			of the Liberal Republican party. Conservatives of both parties distrusted 
			him as a man with a dangerous propensity to advocate "isms," a theoretical
      politician more objectionable than the practical man of machine politics,
      and far more likely to disturb the existing state of affairs and to
      overturn the business of the country in his efforts at reform. As the
      <i>Nation</i> expressed it, "Greeley appears to be 'boiled crow' to more 
			of his fellow citizens than any other candidate for office in this or any 
			other age of which we have record."
    </p>
    <p>
      The regular Republican convention renominated Grant, and the Democrats, as
      the only chance of victory, swallowed the candidate and the platform of
      the Liberals. Doubtless Greeley's opposition to 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_017" id="Page_017">17</a></span>
			the radical reconstruction measures and the fact that he had signed 
			Jefferson Davis's bail-bond made the "crow" more palatable to the Southern 
			Democrats. In the campaign Greeley's brilliant speeches were listened to 
			with great respect. His tour was a personal triumph; but the very voters 
			who hung eagerly on his speeches felt him to be too impulsive and 
			opinionated to be trusted with presidential powers. They knew the worst 
			which might be expected of Grant; they could not guess the ruin which 
			Greeley's dynamic powers might bring on the country if he used them 
			unwisely. In the end many of the original leaders of the Liberal movement 
			supported Grant as the lesser of two evils. The Liberal defection from the 
			Republican ranks was more than offset by the refusal of Democrats to vote 
			for Greeley, and Grant was triumphantly re&euml;lected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Liberal Republican party was undoubtedly weakened by the unfortunate
      selection of their candidate, but it scarcely could have been victorious
      with another candidate. The movement was distinctly one of leaders rather
      than of the masses, and the things for which it stood most 
			specifically&mdash;the removal of political disabilities in the South and 
			civil service reform&mdash;awakened little enthusiasm
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_018" id="Page_018">18</a></span>
			among the farmers of the West. These farmers on the
      other hand were beginning to be very much interested in a number of
      economic reforms which would vitally affect their welfare, such as the
      reduction and readjustment of the burden of taxation, the control of
      corporations in the interests of the people, the reduction and regulation
      of the cost of transportation, and an increase in the currency supply. Some
      of these propositions occasionally received recognition in Liberal
      speeches and platforms, but several of them were anathema to many of the
      Eastern leaders of that movement. Had these leaders been gifted with
      vision broad enough to enable them to appreciate the vital economic and
      social problems of the West, the Liberal Republican movement might perhaps
      have caught the ground swell of agrarian discontent, and the outcome might
      then have been the formation of an enduring national party of liberal
      tendencies broader and more progressive than the Liberal Republican party
      yet less likely to be swept into the vagaries of extreme radicalism than
      were the Anti-Monopoly and Greenback parties of after years. A number of
      western Liberals such as A. Scott Sloan in Wisconsin and Ignatius Donnelly
      in Minnesota championed the farmers' cause, it is true, and in 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_019" id="Page_019">19</a></span>
			some States
      there was a fusion of party organizations; but men like Schurz and
      Trumbull held aloof from these radical movements, while Easterners like
      Godkin of the <i>Nation</i> met them with ridicule and invective.
    </p>
    <p>
      The period from 1870 to 1873 has been characterized as one of rampant
      prosperity, and such it was for the commercial, the manufacturing, and
      especially the speculative interests of the country. For the farmers,
      however, it was a period of bitter depression. The years immediately
      following the close of the Civil War had seen a tremendous expansion of
      production, particularly of the staple crops. The demobilization of the
      armies, the closing of war industries, increased immigration, the
      homestead law, the introduction of improved machinery, and the rapid
      advance of the railroads had all combined to drive the agricultural
      frontier westward by leaps and bounds until it had almost reached the
      limit of successful cultivation under conditions which then prevailed. As
      crop acreage and production increased, prices went down in accordance with
      the law of supply and demand, and farmers all over the country found it
      difficult to make a living.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the West and South&mdash;the great agricultural 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_020" id="Page_020">20</a></span>
			districts of the
      country&mdash;the farmers commonly bought their supplies and implements on
      credit or mortgaged their crops in advance; and their profits at best were
      so slight that one bad season might put them thereafter entirely in the
      power of their creditors and force them to sell their crops on their
      creditors' terms. Many farms were heavily mortgaged, too, at rates of
      interest that ate up the farmers' profits. During and after the Civil War
      the fluctuation of the currency and the high tariff worked especial
      hardship on the farmers as producers of staples which must be sold abroad
      in competition with European products and as consumers of manufactured
      articles which must be bought at home at prices made arbitrarily high by
      the protective tariff. In earlier times, farmers thus harassed would have
      struck their tents and moved farther west, taking up desirable land on the
      frontier and starting out in a fresh field of opportunity. It was still
      possible for farmers to go west, and many did so but only to find that the
      opportunity for economic independence on the edge of settlement had
      largely disappeared. The era of the self-sufficing pioneer was drawing to
      a close, and the farmer on the frontier, forced by natural conditions over
      which he had no control to engage in the production 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_021" id="Page_021">21</a></span>
			of staples, was fully as dependent on the market and on transportation 
			facilities as was his competitor in the East.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fall of 1873 came the greatest panic in the history of the nation,
      and a period of financial depression began which lasted throughout the
      decade, restricting industry, commerce, and even immigration. On the
      farmers the blow fell with special severity. At the very time when they
      found it most difficult to realize profit on their sales of produce,
      creditors who had hitherto carried their debts from year to year became
      insistent for payment. When mortgages fell due, it was well-nigh
      impossible to renew them; and many a farmer saw years of labor go for
      nothing in a heart-breaking foreclosure sale. It was difficult to get even
      short-term loans, running from seed-time to harvest. This important
      function of lending money to pay for labor and thus secure a larger crop,
      which has only recently been assumed by the Government in its
      establishment of farm loan banks, had been performed by private
      capitalists who asked usurious rates of interest. The farmers' protests
      against these rates had been loud; and now, when they found themselves
      unable to get loans at any rate whatever, their complaints naturally
      increased. 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_022" id="Page_022">22</a></span>
			Looking around for one cause to which to attribute all their
      misfortunes, they pitched upon the corporations or monopolies, as they
      chose to call them, and especially upon the railroads.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first the farmers had looked upon the coming of the railroads as an
      unmixed blessing. The railroad had meant the opening up of new territory,
      the establishment of channels of transportation by which they could send
      their crops to market. Without the railroad, the farmer who did not live
      near a navigable stream must remain a backwoodsman; he must make his own
      farm or his immediate community a self-sufficing unit; he must get from
      his own land bread and meat and clothing for his family; he must be
      stock-raiser, grain-grower, farrier, tinker, soap-maker, tanner, 
			chandler&mdash;Jack-of-all-trades and master of none. With the railroad 
			he gained access to markets and the opportunity to specialize in one kind 
			of farming; he could now sell his produce and buy in exchange many of the 
			articles he had previously made for himself at the expense of much time 
			and labor. Many farmers and farming communities bought railroad bonds in 
			the endeavor to increase transportation facilities; all were heartily in 
			sympathy with the policy of the Government in granting to corporations land 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_023" id="Page_023">23</a></span>
			along the route of the railways which they were to construct.
    </p>
    <p>
      By 1873, however, the Government had actually given to the railroads about
      thirty-five million acres, and was pledged to give to the Pacific roads
      alone about one hundred and forty-five million acres more. Land was now
      not so plentiful as it had been in 1850, when this policy had been
      inaugurated, and the farmers were naturally aggrieved that the railroads
      should own so much desirable land and should either hold it for
      speculative purposes or demand for it prices much higher than the
      Government had asked for land adjacent to it and no less valuable.
      Moreover, when railroads were merged and reorganized or passed into the
      hands of receivers the shares held by farmers were frequently wiped out or
      were greatly decreased in value. Often railroad stock had been "watered"
      to such an extent that high freight charges were necessary in order to
      permit the payment of dividends. Thus the farmer might find himself
      without his railroad stock, with a mortgage on his land which he had
      incurred in order to buy the stock, with an increased burden of taxation
      because his township had also been gullible enough to buy stock, and with
      a railroad whose excessive 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_024" id="Page_024">24</a></span>
			rates allowed him but a narrow margin of profit on his produce.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the farmers sought political remedies for their economic ills, they
      discovered that, as a class, they had little representation or influence
      either in Congress or in the state legislatures. Before the Civil War the
      Southern planter had represented agricultural interests in Congress fairly
      well; after the War the dominance of Northern interests left the Western
      farmer without his traditional ally in the South. Political power was
      concentrated in the East and in the urban sections of the West. Members of
      Congress were increasingly likely to be from the manufacturing classes or
      from the legal profession, which sympathized with these classes rather
      than with the agriculturists. Only about seven per cent of the members of
      Congress were farmers; yet in 1870 forty-seven per cent of the population
      was engaged in agriculture. The only remedy for the farmers was to
      organize themselves as a class in order to promote their common welfare.

    </h2>
    <p class="chaptertitle">The Granger Movement at Flood Tide</p>
		
    <p class="noindent">
      <span class="smcap">With</span> 
			these real or fancied grievances crying for redress, the farmers soon
      turned to the Grange as the weapon ready at hand to combat the forces
      which they believed were conspiring to crush them. In 1872 began the real
      spread of the order. Where the Grange had previously reckoned in terms of
      hundreds of new lodges, it now began to speak of thousands. State Granges
      were established in States where the year before the organization had
      obtained but a precarious foothold; pioneer local Granges invaded regions
      which hitherto had been impenetrable. Although the only States which were
      thoroughly organized were Iowa, Minnesota, South Carolina, and
      Mississippi, the rapid spread of the order into other States and its
      intensive growth in regions so far apart gave promise of its ultimate
      development into a national movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      This development was, to be sure, not without 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_026" id="Page_026">26</a></span>
			opposition. When the Grangers began to speak of their function in terms of 
			business and political co&ouml;peration, the forces against which they were 
			uniting took alarm. The commission men and local merchants of the South 
			were especially apprehensive and, it is said, sometimes foreclosed the 
			mortgages of planters who were so independent as to join the order. But 
			here, as elsewhere, persecution defeated its own end; the opposition of 
			their enemies convinced the farmers of the merits of the Grange.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the East, several circumstances retarded the movement. In the first
      place, the Eastern farmer had for some time felt the Western farmer to be
      his serious rival. The Westerner had larger acreage and larger yields from
      his virgin soil than the Easterner from his smaller tracts of well-nigh
      exhausted land. What crops the latter did produce he must sell in
      competition with the Western crops, and he was not eager to lower freight
      charges for his competitor. A second deterrent to the growth of the order
      in the East was the organization of two Granges among the commission men
      and the grain dealers of Boston and New York, under the &aelig;gis of that
      clause of the constitution which declared any person interested in
      agriculture to be eligible to membership in the order. Though the storm of
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_027" id="Page_027">27</a></span>
      protest which arose all over the country against this betrayal to the
      enemy resulted in the revoking of the charters for these Granges, the
      Eastern farmer did not soon forget the incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      The year 1873 is important in the annals of the Grange because it marks
      the retirement of the "founders" from power. In January of that year, at
      the sixth session of the National Grange, the temporary organization of
      government clerks was replaced by a permanent corporation, officered by
      farmers. Kelley was re&euml;lected Secretary; Dudley W. Adams of Iowa was 
			made Master; and William Saunders, erstwhile Master of the National 
			Grange, D. Wyatt Aiken of South Carolina, and E.&nbsp;R. Shankland of Iowa 
			were elected to the executive committee. The substitution of alert and 
			eager workers, already experienced in organizing Granges, for the dead 
			wood of the Washington bureaucrats gave the order a fresh impetus to 
			growth. From the spring of 1873 to the following spring the number of 
			granges more than quadrupled, and the increase again centered mainly in 
			the Middle West.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of 1873 the Grange had penetrated all but four 
			States&mdash;Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware, and Nevada&mdash;and 
			there were thirty-two state Granges in existence. The movement 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_028" id="Page_028">28</a></span>
			was now well defined and national in scope, so that the seventh annual 
			session of the National Grange, which took place in St. Louis in February, 
			1874, attracted much interest and comment. Thirty-three men and twelve 
			women attended the meetings, representing thirty-two state and territorial 
			Granges and about half a million members. Their most important act was the 
			adoption of the "Declaration of Purposes of the National Grange," 
			subscribed to then and now as the platform of the Patrons and copied with 
			minor modifications by many later agricultural organizations in the 
			United States. The general purpose of the Patrons was "to labor for the 
			good of our Order, our Country, and Mankind." This altruistic ideal was to 
			find practical application in efforts to enhance the comfort and 
			attractions of homes, to maintain the laws, to advance agricultural and 
			industrial education, to diversify crops, to systematize farm work, to 
			establish co&ouml;perative buying and selling, to suppress personal, 
			local, sectional, and national prejudices, and to discountenance "the 
			credit system, the fashion system, and every other system tending to 
			prodigality and bankruptcy." As to business, the Patrons declared 
			themselves enemies not of capital but of the tyranny of monopolies, not 
			of railroads 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_029" id="Page_029">29</a></span>
			but of their high freight tariffs and monopoly of transportation. In 
			politics, too, they maintained a rather nice balance: the Grange was 
			not to be a political or party organization, but its members were to 
			perform their political duties as individual citizens.
    </p>
    <p>
      It could hardly be expected that the program of the Grange would satisfy
      all farmers. For the agricultural discontent, as for any other
      dissatisfaction, numerous panaceas were proposed, the advocates of each of
      which scorned all the others and insisted on their particular remedy. Some
      farmers objected to the Grange because it was a secret organization;
      others, because it was nonpartisan. For some the organization was too
      conservative; for others, too radical. Yet all these objectors felt the
      need of some sort of organization among the farmers, very much as the
      trade-unionist and the socialist, though widely divergent in program,
      agree that the workers must unite in order to better their condition.
      Hence during these years of activity on the part of the Grange many other
      agricultural societies were formed, differing from the Patrons of
      Husbandry in specific program rather than in general purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most important of these societies were the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_030" id="Page_030">30</a></span>
			farmers' clubs, at first
      more or less independent of each other but later banded together in state
      associations. The most striking differences of these clubs from the
      Granges were their lack of secrecy and their avowed political purposes.
      Their establishment marks the definite entrance of the farmers as a class
      into politics. During the years 1872 to 1875 the independent farmers'
      organizations multiplied much as the Granges did and for the same reasons.
      The Middle West again was the scene of their greatest power. In Illinois
      this movement began even before the Grange appeared in the State, and its
      growth during the early seventies paralleled that of the secret order. In
      other States also, notably in Kansas, there sprang up at this time
      agricultural clubs of political complexion, and where they existed in
      considerable numbers they generally took the lead in the political
      activities of the farmers' movement. Where the Grange had the field
      practically to itself, as in Iowa and Minnesota, the restriction in the
      constitution of the order as to political or partisan activity was evaded
      by the simple expedient of holding meetings "outside the gate," at which
      platforms were adopted, candidates nominated, and plans made for county,
      district, and state conventions.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_031" id="Page_031">31</a></span>
      In some cases the farmers hoped, by a show of strength, to achieve the
      desired results through one or both of the old parties, but they soon
      decided that they could enter politics effectively only by way of a third
      party. The professional politicians were not inclined to espouse new and
      radical issues which might lead to the disruption of party lines. The
      outcome, therefore, was the establishment of new parties in eleven of the
      Western States during 1873 and 1874. Known variously as Independent,
      Reform, Anti-Monopoly, or Farmers' parties, these organizations were all
      parts of the same general movement, and their platforms were quite
      similar. The paramount demands were: first, the subjection of
      corporations, and especially of railroad corporations, to the control of
      the State; and second, reform and economy in government. After the new
      parties were well under way, the Democrats in most of the States, being in
      a hopeless minority, made common cause with them in the hope of thus
      compassing the defeat of their hereditary rivals, the old-line
      Republicans. In Missouri, however, where the Democracy had been restored
      to power by the Liberal-Republican movement, the new party received the
      support of the Republicans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Illinois, where the farmers were first thoroughly 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_032" id="Page_032">32</a></span>
			organized into clubs and Granges, was naturally the first State in which 
			they took effective political action. The agitation for railroad 
			regulation, which began in Illinois in the sixties, had caused the new 
			state constitution of 1870 to include mandatory provisions directing the 
			legislature to pass laws to prevent extortion and unjust discrimination in 
			railway charges. One of the acts passed by the Legislature of 1871 in an 
			attempt to carry out these instructions was declared unconstitutional by 
			the state supreme court in January, 1873. This was the spark to the 
			tinder. In the following April the farmers flocked to a convention at the 
			state capital and so impressed the legislators that they passed more 
			stringent and effective laws for the regulation of railroads. But the 
			politicians had a still greater surprise in store for them. In the 
			elections of judges in June, the farmers retired from office the judge 
			who had declared their railroad law unconstitutional and elected their own 
			candidates for the two vacancies in the supreme court and for many of the
			vacancies in the circuit courts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now began a vigorous campaign for the election of farmers' candidates in
      the county elections in the fall. So many political meetings were held on
      Independence Day in 1873 that it was referred to as 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_033" id="Page_033">33</a></span>
			the "Farmers' Fourth of July." This had always been the greatest day of 
			the farmer's year, for it meant opportunity for social and intellectual 
			enjoyment in the picnics and celebrations which brought neighbors together 
			in hilarious good-fellowship. In 1873, however, the gatherings took on 
			unwonted seriousness. The accustomed spread-eagle oratory gave place to 
			impassioned denunciation of corporations and to the solemn reading of a 
			<i>Farmers' Declaration of Independence</i>. "When, in the course of human 
			events," this document begins in words familiar to every schoolboy orator, 
			"it becomes necessary for a class of the people, suffering from long 
			continued systems of oppression and abuse, to rouse themselves from an 
			apathetic indifference to their own interests, which has become habitual 
			&hellip; a decent respect for the opinions of mankind requires that they 
			should declare the causes that impel them to a course so necessary to 
			their own protection." Then comes a statement of "self-evident truths," 
			a catalogue of the sins of the railroads, a denunciation of railroads and 
			Congress for not having redressed these wrongs, and finally the 
			conclusion:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      We, therefore, the producers of the state in our several counties
      assembled &hellip; do solemnly declare 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_034" id="Page_034">34</a></span>
			that we will use all lawful and peaceable
      means to free ourselves from the tyranny of monopoly, and that we will
      never cease our efforts for reform until every department of our
      Government gives token that the reign of licentious extravagance is over,
      and something of the purity, honesty, and frugality with which our fathers
      inaugurated it, has taken its place.
    </p>
    <p>
      That to this end we hereby declare ourselves absolutely free and
      independent of all past political connections, and that we will give our
      suffrage only to such men for office, as we have good reason to believe
      will use their best endeavors to the promotion of these ends; and for the
      support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on divine Providence, we
      mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred
      honor.
    </p>
		</blockquote>
    <p>
      This fall campaign of 1873 in Illinois broke up old party lines in
      remarkable fashion. In some counties the Republicans and in other counties
      the Democrats either openly joined the "Reformers" or refrained from
      making separate nominations. Of the sixty-six counties which the new party
      contested, it was victorious in fifty-three. This first election resulted
      in the best showing which the Reformers made in Illinois. In state
      elections, the new party was less successful; the farmers who voted for
      their neighbors running on an Anti-Monopoly ticket for lesser offices
      hesitated to vote for strangers for state office.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_035" id="Page_035">35</a></span>
      Other Middle Western States at this time also felt the uneasy stirring of
      radical political thought and saw the birth of third parties, short-lived,
      most of them, but throughout their brief existence crying loudly and
      persistently for reforms of all description. The tariff, the civil service
      system, and the currency, all came in for their share of criticism and of
      suggestions for revision, but the dominant note was a strident demand for
      railroad regulation. Heirs of the Liberal Republicans and precursors of
      the Greenbackers and Populists, these independent parties were as voices
      crying in the wilderness, preparing the way for national parties of
      reform. The notable achievement of the independent parties in the domain
      of legislation was the enactment of laws to regulate railroads in five
      States of the upper Mississippi Valley. &sup1; When these laws were passed, the
      parties had done their work. By 1876 they had disappeared or, in a few
      instances, had merged with the Greenbackers. Their temporary successes had
      demonstrated, however, to both farmers and professional politicians that
      if once solidarity could be obtained among the agricultural class, that
      class would become the controlling element in the politics of the Middle
      Western States. It is not 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_036" id="Page_036">36</a></span>
			surprising, therefore, that wave after wave of
      reform swept over the West in the succeeding decades.

    <p>
      The independent parties of the middle seventies were distinctly
      spontaneous uprisings of the people and especially of the farmers, rather
      than movements instigated by politicians for personal ends or by
      professional reformers. This circumstance was a source both of strength
      and weakness. As the movements began to develop unexpected power,
      politicians often attempted to take control but, where they succeeded, the
      movement was checked by the farmers' distrust of these self-appointed
      leaders. On the other hand, the new parties suffered from the lack of
      skillful and experienced leaders. The men who managed their campaigns and
      headed their tickets were usually well-to-do farmers drafted from the
      ranks, with no more political experience than perhaps a term or two in the
      state legislature. Such were Willard C. Flagg, president of the Illinois
      State Farmers' Association, Jacob G. Vale, candidate for governor in Iowa,
      and William R. Taylor, the Granger governor of Wisconsin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taylor is typical of the picturesque and forceful figures which frontier
      life so often developed. He was born in Connecticut, of parents recently 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_037" id="Page_037">37</a></span>
      emigrated from Scotland. Three weeks after his birth his mother died, and
      six years later his father, a sea captain, was drowned. The orphan boy,
      brought up by strangers in Jefferson County, New York, experienced the
      hardships of frontier life and developed that passion for knowledge which
      so frequently is found in those to whom education is denied. When he was
      sixteen, he had, enough of the rudiments to take charge of a country
      school, and by teaching in the winter and working in the summer he earned
      enough to enter Union College. He was unable to complete the course,
      however, and turned to teaching in Ohio, where he restored to decent order
      a school notorious for bullying its luckless teachers. But teaching was
      not to be his career; indeed, Taylor's versatility for a time threatened
      to make him the proverbial Jack-of-all-trades: he was employed
      successively in a grist mill, a saw mill, and an iron foundry; he dabbled
      in the study of medicine; and finally, in the year which saw Wisconsin
      admitted to the Union, he bought a farm in that State. Ownership of
      property steadied his interests and at the same time afforded an adequate
      outlet for his energies. He soon made his farm a model for the
      neighborhood and managed it so efficiently that he had time to interest
      himself 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_038" id="Page_038">38</a></span>
			in farmers' organizations and to hold positions of trust in his
      township and county.
    </p>
    <p>
      By 1873 Taylor had acquired considerable local political experience and
      had even held a seat in the state senate. As president of the State
      Agricultural Society, he was quite naturally chosen to head the ticket of
      the new Liberal Reform party. The brewing interests of the State, angered
      at a drastic temperance law enacted by the preceding legislature, swung
      their support to Taylor. Thus re&euml;nforced, he won the election. As 
			governor he made vigorous and tireless attempts to enforce the Granger 
			railroad laws, and on one occasion he scandalized the conventional 
			citizens of the State by celebrating a favorable court decision in one of 
			the Granger cases with a salvo of artillery from the capitol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet in spite of this prominence, Taylor, after his defeat for 
			re&euml;lection in 1875, retired to his farm and to obscurity. His vivid 
			personality was not again to assert itself in public affairs. It is 
			difficult to account for the fact that so few of the farmers during the 
			Granger period played prominent parts in later phases of the agrarian 
			crusade. The rank and file of the successive parties must have been much 
			the same, but each wave of the movement swept new leaders to the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_039" id="Page_039">39</a></span>
      The one outstanding exception among the leaders of the Anti-Monopolists
      was Ignatius Donnelly of Minnesota&mdash;"the sage of Nininger"&mdash;who
      remained a captain of the radical cohorts in every agrarian movement until
      his death in 1901. A red-headed aggressive Irishman, with a magnetic
      personality and a remarkable intellect, Donnelly went to Minnesota from
      Pennsylvania in 1856 and speculated in town sites on a large scale. When
      he was left stranded by the panic of 1857, acting upon his own principle
      that "to hide one's light under a bushel is to extinguish it," he entered
      the political arena. In Pennsylvania Donnelly had been a Democrat, but his
      genuine sympathy for the oppressed made him an opponent of slavery and
      consequently a Republican. In 1857 and 1858 he ran for the state senate in
      Minnesota on the Republican ticket in a hopelessly Democratic county. In
      1859 he was nominated for lieutenant governor on the ticket headed by
      Alexander Ramsey; and his caustic wit, his keenness in debate, and his
      eloquence made him a valuable asset in the battle-royal between
      Republicans and Democrats for the possession of Minnesota. As lieutenant
      governor, Donnelly early showed his sympathy with the farmers by
      championing laws which lowered the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_040" id="Page_040">40</a></span>
			legal rate of interest and which made more humane the process of 
			foreclosure on mortgages. The outbreak of the Civil War gave him an 
			opportunity to demonstrate his executive ability as acting governor during 
			Ramsey's frequent trips to Washington. In this capacity he issued the 
			first proclamation for the raising of Minnesota troops in response to the 
			call of President Lincoln. Elected to Congress in 1862, he served three 
			terms and usually supported progressive legislation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Donnelly's growing popularity and his ambition for promotion to the Senate
      soon became a matter of alarm to the friends of Senator Ramsey, who
      controlled the Republican party in the State. They determined to prevent
      Donnelly's renomination in 1868 and selected William D. Washburn of
      Minneapolis to make the race against him. In the spring of this year
      Donnelly engaged in a controversy with Representative E.&nbsp;B. Washburn 
			of Illinois, a brother of W.&nbsp;D. Washburn, in the course of which the 
			Illinois congressman published a letter in a St. Paul paper attacking 
			Donnelly's personal character. Believing this to be part of the campaign 
			against him, the choleric Minnesotan replied in the house with a 
			remarkable rhetorical display which greatly entertained the members but 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_041" id="Page_041">41</a></span>
			did not increase their respect for him. His opponents at home made 
			effective use of this affair, and the outcome of the contest was a 
			divided convention, the nomination of two Republicans, each claiming to 
			be the regular candidate of the party, and the ultimate election of a 
			Democrat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Donnelly was soon ready to break with the old guard of the Republican
      party in national as well as in state politics. In 1870 he ran for
      Congress as an independent Republican on a low tariff platform but was
      defeated in spite of the fact that he received the endorsement of the
      Democratic convention. Two years later he joined the Liberal Republicans
      in supporting Greeley against Grant. When the farmers' Granges began to
      spring up like mushrooms in 1873, Donnelly was quick to see the political
      possibilities of the movement. He conducted an extensive correspondence
      with farmers, editors, and politicians of radical tendencies all over the
      State and played a leading part in the organization of the Anti-Monopoly
      party. He was elected to the state senate in 1873, and in the following
      year he started a newspaper, the <i>Anti-Monopolist</i>, to serve as the 
			organ of the movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Donnelly was technically still a farmer, he was quite content to
      leave the management of his 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_042" id="Page_042">42</a></span>
			farm to his capable wife, while he made politics his profession, with 
			literature and lecturing as avocations. His frequent and brilliant 
			lectures no less than his voluminous writings &sup1; attest his amazing 
			industry. Democrat, Republican, Liberal-Republican, and Anti-Monopolist; 
			speculator, lawyer, farmer, lecturer, stump-speaker, editor, and author; 
			preacher of morals and practicer of shrewd political evasions; and always 
			a radical&mdash;he was for many years a force to be reckoned with in the 
			politics of his State and of the nation.

    <p class="chaptertitle">Curbing the Railroads</p>

    <p class="noindent">
      <span class="smcap">Though</span> 
			the society of the Patrons of Husbandry was avowedly non-political
      in character, there is ample justification for the use of the term
      "Granger" in connection with the radical railroad legislation enacted in
      the Northwestern States during the seventies. The fact that the Grange did
      not take direct political action is immaterial: certainly the order made
      political action on the part of the farmers possible by establishing among
      them a feeling of mutual confidence and trust whereby they could organize
      to work harmoniously for their common cause. Before the advent of the
      Patrons of Husbandry the farmers were so isolated from each other that
      co&ouml;peration was impossible. It is hard for us to imagine, familiar as we
      are with the rural free delivery of mail, with the country telephone line,
      with the automobile, how completely the average farmer of 1865 was cut off
      from communication 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_044" id="Page_044">44</a></span>
			with the outside world. His dissociation from any but
      his nearest neighbors made him unsocial, narrow-minded, bigoted, and
      suspicious. He believed that every man's hand was against him, and he was
      therefore often led to turn his hand against every man. Not until he was
      convinced that he might at least trust the Grangers did he lay aside his
      suspicions and join with other farmers in the attempt to obtain what they
      considered just railroad legislation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain it is, moreover, that the Grangers made use of the popular
      hostility to the railroads in securing membership for the order.
      "Co&ouml;peration" and "Down with Monopoly" were two of the slogans most
      commonly used by the Grange between 1870 and 1875 and were in large part
      responsible for its great expansion. Widely circulated reprints of
      articles exposing graft and corruption made excellent fuel for the flames
      of agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      How much of the farmers' bitterness against the railroads was justified it
      is difficult to determine. Some of it was undoubtedly due to prejudice, to
      the hostility of the "producer" for the "nonproducer," and to the
      suspicion which the Western farmer felt for the Eastern magnate. But much
      of the suspicion was not without foundation. In 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_045" id="Page_045">45</a></span>
			some cases manipulation of
      railway stock had absolutely cheated farmers and agricultural towns and
      counties out of their investments. It is a well-known fact that the
      corporations were not averse to creating among legislators a disposition
      to favor their interests. Passes were commonly given by the railroads to
      all public officials, from the local supervisors to the judges of the
      Supreme Court, and opportunities were offered to legislators to buy stock
      far below the market price. In such subtle ways the railroads insinuated
      themselves into favor among the makers and interpreters of law. Then, too,
      the farmers felt that the railway companies made rates unnecessarily high
      and frequently practised unfair discrimination against certain sections
      and individuals. When the Iowa farmer was obliged to burn corn for fuel,
      because at fifteen cents a bushel it was cheaper than coal, though at the
      same time it was selling for a dollar in the East, he felt that there was
      something wrong, and quite naturally accused the railroads of extortion.
    </p>

      The fundamental issue involved in Illinois, Minnesota, Iowa, and
      Wisconsin, where the battle was begun and fought to a finish, was whether
      or not a State had power to regulate the tariffs of railway companies
      incorporated under its laws. 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_046" id="Page_046">46</a></span>
			Railway companies, many jurists argued, were
      private concerns transacting business according to the laws of the State
      and no more to be controlled in making rates than dry goods companies in
      fixing the price of spools of thread; rates, like the price of
      merchandise, were determined by the volume of trade and the amount of
      competition, and for a State to interfere with them was nothing less than
      tyranny. On the other hand, those who advocated regulation argued that
      railroads, though private corporations, were from the nature of their
      business public servants and, as such, should be subject to state
      regulation and control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some States, foreseeing difficulties which might arise later from the
      doctrine that a charter is a contract, as set forth by the United States
      Supreme Court in the famous Dartmouth College case, &sup1; had quite early 
			in their history attempted to safeguard their right to legislate 
			concerning corporations. A clause had been inserted in the state 
			constitution of Wisconsin which declared that all laws creating 
			corporations might at any time be altered or repealed by the legislatures. 
			The constitution of Minnesota asserted specifically that the railroads, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_047" id="Page_047">47</a></span>
			as common carriers enjoying right of way, were bound to carry freight on 
			equal and reasonable terms. When the Legislature of Iowa turned over to 
			the railroad companies lands granted by the Federal Government, it did so 
			with the reservation that the companies should be subject to the rules and 
			regulations of the General Assembly. Thus these States were fortified not 
			only by arguments from general governmental theory but also by written 
			articles, more or less specifically phrased, on which they relied to 
			establish their right to control the railroads.

    <p>
      The first gun in this fight for railroad regulation was fired in Illinois.
      As early as 1869, after several years of agitation, the legislature passed
      an act declaring that railroads should be limited to "just, reasonable,
      and uniform rates," but, as no provision was made for determining what
      such rates were, the act was a mere encumbrance on the statute books. In
      the new state constitution of 1870, however, the framers, influenced by a
      growing demand on the part of the farmers which manifested itself in a
      Producers' Convention, inserted a section directing the legislature to
      "pass laws to correct abuses and to prevent unjust discrimination and
      extortion in the rates of freight and 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_048" id="Page_048">48</a></span>
			passenger tariffs on the different railroads in this State." The 
			legislature at its next session appears to have made an honest attempt to 
			obey these instructions. One act established maximum passenger fares 
			varying from two and one-half to five and one-half cents a mile for the 
			different classes into which the roads were divided. Another provided, in 
			effect, that freight charges should be based entirely upon distance 
			traversed and prohibited any increases over rates in 1870. This amounted 
			to an attempt to force all rates to the level of the lowest competitive 
			rates of that year. Finally, a third act established a board of railroad 
			and warehouse commissioners charged with the enforcement of these and 
			other laws and with the collection of information.
    </p>
    <p>
      The railroad companies, denying the right of the State to regulate their
      business, flatly refused to obey the laws; and the state supreme court
      declared the act regulating freight rates unconstitutional on the ground
      that it attempted to prevent not only unjust discrimination but any
      discrimination at all. The legislature then passed the Act of 1873, which
      avoided the constitutional pitfall by providing that discriminatory rates
      should be considered as <i>prima facie</i> but not absolute evidence 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_049" id="Page_049">49</a></span>
			of unjust discrimination. The railroads were thus permitted to adduce 
			evidence to show that the discrimination was justified, but the act 
			expressly stated that the existence of competition at some points and its 
			nonexistence at others should not be deemed a sufficient justification of 
			discrimination. In order to prevent the roads from raising all rates to 
			the level of the highest instead of lowering them to the level of the 
			lowest, the commissioners were directed to establish a schedule of maximum 
			rates; and the charging of rates higher than these by any company after 
			January 15, 1874, was to be considered <i>prima facie</i> evidence of 
			extortion. Other provisions increased the penalties for violations and 
			strengthened the enforcing powers of the commission in other ways. This 
			act was roundly denounced at the time, especially in the East, as an 
			attempt at confiscation, and the railroad companies refused to obey it for 
			several years; but ultimately it stood the test of the courts and became 
			the permanent basis of railroad regulation in Illinois and the model for 
			the solution of this problem in many other States.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first Granger law of Minnesota, enacted in 1871, established fixed
      schedules for both passengers and freight, while another act of the same
      year 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_050" id="Page_050">50</a></span>
			provided for a railroad commissioner. In this instance also the
      companies denied the validity of the law, and when the state supreme court
      upheld it in 1873, they appealed to the Supreme Court of the United
      States. In the meantime there was no way of enforcing the law, and the
      antagonism toward the roads fostered by the Grange and the Anti-Monopoly
      party became more and more intense. In 1874 the legislature replaced the
      Act of 1871 with one modeled on the Illinois law of 1873; but it soon
      discovered that no workable set of uniform rates could be made for the
      State because of the wide variation of conditions in the different
      sections. Rates and fares which would be just to the companies in the
      frontier regions of the State would be extortionate in the thickly
      populated areas. This difficulty could have been avoided by giving the
      commission power to establish varying schedules for different sections of
      the same road; but the anti-railroad sentiment was beginning to die down,
      and the Legislature of 1875, instead of trying to improve the law,
      abandoned the attempt at state regulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Granger laws of Iowa and Wisconsin, both enacted in 1874, attempted to
      establish maximum rates by direct legislative action, although 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_051" id="Page_051">51</a></span>
			commissions were also created to collect information and assist in 
			enforcing the laws. The Iowa law was very carefully drawn and appears to 
			have been observed, in form at least, by most of the companies while it 
			remained in force. In 1878, however, a systematic campaign on the part of 
			the railroad forces resulted in the repeal of the act. In Wisconsin, a 
			majority of the members of the Senate favored the railroads and, fearing 
			to show their hands, attempted to defeat the proposed legislation by 
			substituting the extremely radical Potter Bill for the moderate measure 
			adopted by the Assembly. The senators found themselves hoist with their 
			own petard, however, for the lower house, made up largely of Grangers, 
			accepted this bill rather than let the matter of railroad legislation go 
			by default. The rates fixed by the Potter Law for many commodities were 
			certainly unreasonably low, although the assertion of a railroad official 
			that the enforcement of the law would cut off twenty-five per cent of the 
			gross earnings of the companies was a decided exaggeration. Relying upon 
			the advice of such eminent Eastern lawyers as William M. Evarts, Charles 
			O'Conor, E. Rockwood Hoar, and Benjamin R. Curtis that the law was 
			invalid, the roads refused to obey it until it was 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_052" id="Page_052">52</a></span>
			upheld by the state supreme court late in 1874. They then began a 
			campaign for its repeal. Though they obtained only some modification in 
			1875, they succeeded completely in 1876.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contest between the railroads and the farmers was intense while it
      lasted. The farmers had votes; the railroads had money; and the
      legislators were sometimes between the devil and the deep sea in the fear
      of offending one side or the other. The farmers' methods of campaign were
      simple. Often questionnaires were distributed to all candidates for
      office, and only those who went on record as favoring railroad restriction
      were endorsed by the farmers' clubs and committees. An agricultural
      convention, sometimes even a meeting of the state Grange, would be held at
      the capital of the State while the legislature was in session, and it was
      a bold legislator who, in the presence of his farmer constituents, would
      vote against the measures they approved. When the railroads in Illinois
      refused to lower their passenger rates to conform to the law, adventurous
      farmers often attempted to "ride for legal fares," giving the trainmen the
      alternative of accepting the low fares or throwing the hardy passengers
      from the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      The methods of the railroads in dealing with the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_053" id="Page_053">53</a></span>
			legislators were most subtle. Whether or not the numerous charges of 
			bribery were true, railroad favors were undoubtedly distributed among well 
			disposed legislators. In Iowa passes were not given to the senators who 
			voted against the railroads, and those sent to the men who voted in the 
			railroads' interest were accompanied by notes announcing that free passes 
			were no longer to be given generally but only to the friends of the 
			railroads. At the session of the Iowa Legislature in 1872, four lawyers 
			who posed as farmers and Grange members were well known as lobbyists for 
			the railroads. The senate paid its respects to these men at the close of 
			its session by adopting the following resolution:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      <span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, 
			There have been constantly in attendance on the Senate and House
      of this General Assembly, from the commencement of the session to the
      present time, four gentlemen professing to represent the great
      agricultural interest of the State of Iowa, known as the Grange; and&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, 
      These gentlemen appear entirely destitute of any visible means of
      support; therefore be it&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="smcap">Resolved,</span> 
      By the Senate, the House concurring, that the janitors permit
      aforesaid gentlemen to gather up all the waste paper, old newspapers,
      &amp;c., from under the desks of the members, and they be allowed one
      postage stamp each, <i>The American Agriculturist, What Greeley Knows 
			about Farming</i>, and that they be permitted 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_054" id="Page_054">54</a></span>
			to take with them to their homes, if they have any, all the rejected 
			railroad tariff bills, Beardsley's speech on female suffrage, Claussen's 
			reply, Kasson's speech on barnacles, Blakeley's dog bill, Teale's liquor 
			bill, and be given a pass over the Des Moines Valley Railroad, with the 
			earnest hope that they will never return to Des Moines.
    </p>
		</blockquote>
    <p>
      Once the Granger laws were enacted, the railroads either fought the laws
      in court or obeyed them in such a way as to make them appear most
      obnoxious to the people, or else they employed both tactics. The lawsuits,
      which began as soon as the laws had been passed, dragged on, in appeal
      after appeal, until finally they were settled in the Supreme Court of the
      United States. These suits were not so numerous as might be expected,
      because in most of the States they had to be brought on the initiative of
      the injured shipper, and many shippers feared to incur the animosity of
      the railroad. A farmer was afraid that, if he angered the railroad,
      misfortunes would befall him: his grain might be delivered to the wrong
      elevators or left to stand and spoil in damp freight cars; there might be
      no cars available for grain just when his shipment was ready; and
      machinery destined for him might be delayed at a time when lack of it
      would mean the loss of his crops. The railroads for their part 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_055" id="Page_055">55</a></span>
			whenever
      they found an opportunity to make the new laws appear obnoxious in the
      eyes of the people, were not slow to seize it. That section of the
      Illinois law of 1873 which prohibited unjust discrimination went into
      effect in July, but the maximum freight rates were not fixed until January
      of 1874. As a result of this situation, the railroads in July made all
      their freight rates uniform, according to the law, but accomplished this
      uniformity by raising the low rates instead of lowering the high. In
      Minnesota, similarly, the St. Paul and Pacific road, in its zeal to
      establish uniform passenger rates, raised the fare between St. Paul and
      Minneapolis from three to five cents a mile, in order to make it conform
      to the rates elsewhere in the State. The St. Paul and Sioux City road
      declared that the Granger law made its operation unprofitable, and it so
      reduced its train service that the people petitioned the commission to
      restore the former rate. In Wisconsin, when the state supreme court
      affirmed the constitutionality of the radical Potter law, the railroads
      retaliated in some cases by carrying out their threat to give the public
      "Potter cars, Potter rails, and Potter time." As a result the public soon
      demanded the repeal of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all the States but Illinois the Granger laws were 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_056" id="Page_056">56</a></span>
			repealed before they
      had been given a fair trial. The commissions remained in existence,
      however, although with merely advisory functions; and they sometimes did
      good service in the arbitration of disputes between shippers and
      railroads. Interest in the railroad problem died down for the time, but
      every one of the Granger States subsequently enacted for the regulation of
      railroad rates statutes which, although more scientific than the laws of
      the seventies, are the same in principle. The Granger laws thus paved the
      way not only for future and more enduring legislation in these States but
      also for similar legislation in most of the other States of the Union and
      even for the national regulation of railroads through the Interstate
      Commerce Commission.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Supreme Court of the United States was the theater for the final stage
      of this conflict between the railroads and the farmers. In October, 1876,
      decisions were handed down together in eight cases which had been appealed
      from federal circuit and state courts in Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, and
      Minnesota, and which involved the validity of the Granger laws. The
      fundamental issue was the same in all these cases&mdash;the right of a
      State to regulate a business that is public in nature though privately
      owned and managed.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_057" id="Page_057">57</a></span>
      The first of the "Granger cases," as they were termed by Justice Field in
      a dissenting opinion, was not a railroad case primarily but grew out of
      warehouse legislation which the farmers of Illinois secured in 1871. This
      act established maximum charges for grain storage and required all
      warehousemen to publish their rates for each year during the first week in
      January and to refrain from increasing these rates during the year and
      from discriminating between customers. In an endeavor to enforce this law
      the railroad and warehouse commission brought suit against Munn and Scott,
      a warehouse firm in Chicago, for failure to take out the license required
      by the act. The suit, known as Munn <i>vs</i>. Illinois, finally came to the
      United States Supreme Court and was decided in favor of the State, two of
      the justices dissenting. &sup1; The opinion of the court in this case, delivered
      by Chief Justice Waite, laid down the principles which were followed in
      the railroad cases. The attorneys for the warehousemen had argued that the
      act in question, by assuming to limit charges, amounted to a deprivation
      of property without due process of law and was thus repugnant to the
      Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_058" id="Page_058">58</a></span>
			But the
      court declared that it had long been customary both in England and America
      to regulate by law any business in which the public has an interest, such
      as ferries, common carriers, bakers, or millers, and that the warehouse
      business in question was undoubtedly clothed with such a public interest.
      Further, it was asserted that this right to regulate implied the right to
      fix maximum charges, and that what those charges should be was a
      legislative and not a judicial question.
    </p>

    </p>
		</div>
    <p>
      In deciding the railroad cases the courts applied the same general
      principles, the public nature of the railroad business having already been
      established by a decision in 1872. &sup1; Another point was involved, however,
      because of the contention of the attorneys for the companies that the
      railway charters were contracts and that the enforcement of the laws would
      amount to an impairment of contracts, which was forbidden by the
      Constitution. The court admitted that the charters were contracts but
      denied that state regulation could be considered an impairment of
      contracts unless the terms of the charter were specific. Moreover, it was
      pointed out that contracts must be interpreted in the light of rights
      reserved to the State in its constitution 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_059" id="Page_059">59</a></span>
			and in the light of its general
      laws of incorporation under which the charters were granted.

			&sup1; Olcott <i>vs</i>. The Supervisors, 16 Wallace, 678.
    </p>
		</div>
    <p>
      These court decisions established principles which even now are of vital
      concern to business and politics. From that time to this no one has denied
      the right of States to fix maximum charges for any business which is
      public in its nature or which has been clothed with a public interest; nor
      has the inclusion of the railroad and warehouse businesses in that class
      been questioned. The opinion, however, that this right of the States is
      unlimited, and therefore not subject to judicial review, has been
      practically reversed. In 1890 the Supreme Court declared a Minnesota law
      invalid because it denied a judicial hearing as to the reasonableness of
      rates; &sup1; and the courts now assume it to be their right and duty to
      determine whether or not rates fixed by legislation are so low as to
      amount to a deprivation of property without due process of law. In spite
      of this later limitation upon the power of the States, the Granger
      decisions have furnished the legal basis for state regulation of railroads
      down to the present day. They are the most significant achievements of the
      anti-monopoly movement of the seventies.

      <a href="#Contents">CHAPTER V.</a>
    </h2>
    <p class="chaptertitle">The Collapse of the Granger Movement</p>


    <p class="noindent">
      <span class="smcap">The</span> 
			first phase of the agrarian crusade, which centered around and took
      its distinctive name from the Grange, reached its highwater mark in 1874.
      Early in the next year the tide began to ebb. The number of Granges
      decreased rapidly during the remainder of the decade, and of over twenty
      thousand in 1874 only about four thousand were alive in 1880.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several causes contributed to this sudden decline. Any organization which
      grows so rapidly is prone to decay with equal rapidity; the slower growths
      are better rooted and are more likely to reach fruition. So with the
      Grange. Many farmers had joined the order, attracted by its novelty and
      vogue; others joined the organization in the hope that it would prove a
      panacea for all the ills that agriculture is heir to and then left it in
      disgust when they found its success neither immediate nor universal.
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_061" id="Page_061">61</a></span>
      Its methods of organization, too, while admirably adapted to arousing
      enthusiasm and to securing new chapters quickly, did not make for
      stability and permanence. The Grange deputy, as the organizer was termed,
      did not do enough of what the salesman calls "follow-up work." He went
      into a town, persuaded an influential farmer to go about with him in a
      house-to-house canvass, talked to the other farmers of the vicinity,
      stirred them up to interest and excitement, organized a Grange, and then
      left the town. If he happened to choose the right material, the chapter
      became an active and flourishing organization; if he did not choose
      wisely, it might drag along in a perfunctory existence or even lapse
      entirely. Then, too, the deputy's ignorance of local conditions sometimes
      led him to open the door to the farmers' enemies. There can be little
      doubt that insidious harm was worked through the admission into the Grange
      of men who were farmers only incidentally and whose "interest in
      agriculture" was limited to making profits from the farmer rather than
      from the farm. As D. Wyatt Aiken, deputy for the Grange in the Southern
      States and later member of the executive committee of the National Grange,
      shrewdly commented, "Everybody wanted to join the Grange 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_062" id="Page_062">62</a></span>
			then; lawyers, to get clients; doctors, to get customers; Shylocks, to 
			get their pound of flesh; and sharpers, to catch the babes in the woods."
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only the members who managed thus to insinuate themselves into the
      order but also the legitimate members proved hard to control. With that
      hostility to concentrated authority which so often and so lamentably
      manifests itself in a democratic body, the rank and file looked with
      suspicion upon the few men who constituted the National Grange. The
      average farmer was interested mainly in local issues, conditions, and
      problems, and looked upon the National Grange not as a means of helping
      him in local affairs, but as a combination of monopolists who had taken
      out a patent on the local grange and forced him to pay a royalty in order
      to enjoy its privileges. The demand for reduction in the power of the
      National Grange led to frequent attempts to revise the constitution in the
      direction of decentralization; and the revisions were such as merely to
      impair the power of the National Grange without satisfying the
      discontented members.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the causes of the rapid collapse of the Granger movement, the
      unfortunate experience which the farmers had in their attempts at business
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_063" id="Page_063">63</a></span>
      co&ouml;peration was probably chief. Their hatred of the middleman and of 
			the manufacturer was almost as intense as their hostility to the railroad
      magnate; quite naturally, therefore, the farmers attempted to use their
      new organizations as a means of eliminating the one and controlling the
      other. As in the parallel case of the railroads, the farmers' animosity,
      though it was probably greater than the provocation warranted, was not
      without grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The middlemen&mdash;the commission merchants to whom the farmer sold his
      produce and the retail dealers from whom he bought his supplies&mdash;did
      undoubtedly make use of their opportunities to drive hard bargains. The
      commission merchant had such facilities for storage and such knowledge of
      market conditions that he frequently could take advantage of market
      fluctuations to increase his profits. The farmer who sold his produce at a
      low price and then saw it disposed of as a much higher figure was
      naturally enraged, but he could devise no adequate remedy. Attempts to
      regulate market conditions by creating an artificial shortage seldom met
      with success. The slogan "Hold your hogs" was more effective as a
      catchword than as an economic weapon. The retail dealers, no less than the
      commission men, seemed 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_064" id="Page_064">64</a></span>
			to the farmer to be unjust in their dealings with
      him. In the small agricultural communities there was practically no
      competition. Even where there were several merchants in one town these
      could, and frequently did, combine to fix prices which the farmer had no
      alternative but to pay. What irked the farmer most in connection with
      these "extortions" was that the middleman seemed to be a nonproducer, a
      parasite who lived by draining the agricultural classes of the wealth
      which they produced. Even those farmers who recognized the middleman as a
      necessity had little conception of the intricacy and value of his service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Against the manufacturer, too, the farmer had his grievances. He felt that
      the system of patent rights for farm machinery resulted in unfair 
			prices&mdash;for was not this same machinery shipped to Europe and there 
			sold for less than the retail price in the United States? Any one could 
			see that the manufacturer must have been making more than reasonable 
			profit on domestic sales. Moreover, there were at this time many abuses of 
			patent rights. Patents about to expire were often extended through 
			political influence or renewed by means of slight changes which were 
			claimed to be improvements. A more serious defect 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_065" id="Page_065">65</a></span>
			in the patent system was that new patents were not thoroughly 
			investigated, so that occasionally one was issued on an article which had 
			long been in common use. That a man should take out a patent for the 
			manufacture of a sliding gate which farmers had for years crudely
      constructed for themselves and should then collect royalty from those who
      were using the gates they had made, naturally enough aroused the wrath of
      his victims.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was but natural, then, that the Granges should be drawn into all sorts
      of schemes to divert into the pockets of their members the streams of
      wealth which had previously flowed to the greedy middlemen. The members of
      the National Grange, thinking that these early schemes for 
			co&ouml;peration were premature, did not at first take them up and 
			standardize them but left them entirely in the hands of local, county, and 
			state Granges. These thereupon proceeded to "gang their ain gait" through 
			the unfamiliar paths of business operations and too frequently brought up 
			in a quagmire. "This purchasing business," said Kelley in 1867, 
			"commenced with buying jackasses; the prospects are that many will be 
			<em>sold</em>." But the Grangers went on with their plans for business 
			co&ouml;peration with ardor undampened by such forebodings. Sometimes 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_066" id="Page_066">66</a></span>
			a local Grange would make a bargain with a
      certain dealer of the vicinity, whereby members were allowed special rates
      if they bought with cash and traded only with that dealer. More often the
      local grange would establish an agency, with either a paid or a voluntary
      agent who would forward the orders of the members in large lots to the
      manufacturers or wholesalers and would thus be able to purchase supplies
      for cash at terms considerably lower than the retail prices. Frequently,
      realizing that they could get still more advantageous terms for larger
      orders, the Granges established a county agency which took over the work
      of several local agents. Sometimes the Patrons even embarked upon the more
      ambitious enterprise of co&ouml;perative stores.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most common type of co&ouml;perative store was that in which the capital
      was provided by a stock company of Grange members and which sold goods to
      Patrons at very low prices. The profits, when there were any, were divided
      among the stockholders in proportion to the amount of stock they held,
      just as in any stock company. This type of store was rarely successful for
      any length of time. The low prices at which it sold goods were likely to
      involve it in competition with other merchants. 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_067" id="Page_067">67</a></span>
			Frequently these men would combine to lower their prices and, by a 
			process familiar in the history of business competition, "freeze out" 
			the co&ouml;perative store, after which they might restore their prices 
			to the old levels. The farmers seldom had sufficient spirit to buy at 
			the grange store if they found better bargains elsewhere; so the store 
			was assured of its client&egrave;le only so long as it sold at the 
			lowest possible prices. Farmers' agencies for the disposal of produce 
			met with greater success. Co&ouml;perative creameries and elevators in
      several States are said to have saved Grange members thousands of dollars.
      Sometimes the state Grange, instead of setting up in the business of
      selling produce, chose certain firms as Grange agents and advised Patrons
      to sell through these firms. Where the choice was wisely made, this system
      seems to have saved the farmers about as much money without involving them
      in the risks of business.
    </p>
    <p>
      By 1876 the members of the National Grange had begun to study the problem
      of co&ouml;peration in retailing goods and had come to the conclusion that 
			the so-called "Rochdale plan," a system worked out by an English 
			association, was the most practicable for the co&ouml;perative store. 
			The National Grange therefore recommended this type of 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_068" id="Page_068">68</a></span>
			organization. The stock of these stores was sold only to Patrons, at 
			five dollars a share and in limited amounts; thus the stores were owned 
			by a large number of stockholders, all of whom had equal voice in the 
			management of the company. The stores sold goods at ordinary rates, and 
			then at the end of the year, after paying a small dividend on the stock, 
			divided their profits among the purchasers, according to the amounts 
			purchased. This plan eliminated the violent competition which occurred 
			when a store attempted to sell goods at cost, and at the same time saved 
			the purchaser quite as much. Unfortunately the Rochdale plan found little 
			favor among farmers in the Middle West because of their unfortunate 
			experience with other co&ouml;perative ventures. In the East and South, 
			however, it was adopted more generally and met with sufficient success to 
			testify to the wisdom of the National Grange in recommending it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In its attitude toward manufacturing, the National Grange was less sane.
      Not content with the elimination of the middlemen, the farmers were
      determined to control the manufacture of their implements. With the small
      manufacturer they managed to deal fairly well, for they could usually find
      some one who would supply the Grange with 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_069" id="Page_069">69</a></span>
			implements at less than the retail price. In Iowa, where the state Grange 
			early established an agency for co&ouml;perative buying, the agent 
			managed to persuade a manufacturer of plows to give a discount to 
			Grangers. As a result, this manufacturer's plows are reported to have 
			left the factory with the paint scarcely dry, while his competitors, who 
			had refused to make special terms, had difficulty in disposing of their 
			stock. But the manufacturers of harvesters persistently refused to sell 
			at wholesale rates. The Iowa Grange thereupon determined to do its own 
			manufacturing and succeeded in buying a patent for a harvester which it 
			could make and sell for about half what other harvesters cost. In 1874 
			some 250 of these machines were manufactured, and the prospects looked 
			bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deceived by the apparent success of grange manufacturing in Iowa, officers
      of the order at once planned to embark in manufacturing on a large scale.
      The National Grange was rich in funds at this time; it had within a year
      received well over $250,000 in dispensation fees from seventeen thousand
      new Granges. Angered at what was felt to be the tyranny of monopoly, the
      officers of the National Grange decided to use this capital in
      manufacturing agricultural implements which were to 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_070" id="Page_070">70</a></span>
			be sold to Patrons at
      very low prices. They went about the country buying patents for all sorts
      of farm implements, but not always making sure of the worth of the
      machinery or the validity of the patents. In Kansas, Iowa, Missouri,
      Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky, they planned factories to make
      harvesters, plows, wagons, sewing-machines, threshing-machines, and all
      sorts of farm implements. Then came the crash. The Iowa harvester factory
      failed in 1875 and bankrupted the state Grange. Other failures followed;
      suits for patent infringements were brought against some of the factories;
      local Granges disbanded for fear they might be held responsible for the
      debts incurred; and in the Northwest, where the activity had been the
      greatest, the order almost disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the Grange had a mushroom growth, it nevertheless exerted a real
      and enduring influence upon farmers both as individuals and as members of
      a class. Even the experiments in co&ouml;peration, disastrous though they were
      in the end, were not without useful results. While they lasted they
      undoubtedly effected a considerable saving for the farmers. As Grange
      agents or as stockholders in co&ouml;perative stores or Grange factories, many
      farmers gained valuable business experience which 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_071" id="Page_071">71</a></span>
			helped to prevent them from being victimized thereafter. The farmers 
			learned, moreover, the wisdom of working through the accepted channels 
			of business. Those who had scoffed at the Rochdale plan of 
			co&ouml;peration, in the homely belief that any scheme made in America 
			must necessarily be better than an English importation, came to see that 
			self-confidence and independence must be tempered by willingness to learn 
			from the experience of others. Most important of all, these experiments 
			in business taught the farmers that the middlemen and manufacturers 
			performed services essential to the agriculturalist and that the 
			production and distribution of manufactured articles and the distribution 
			of crops are far more complex affairs than the farmers had imagined and 
			perhaps worthy of more compensation than they had been accustomed to 
			think just. On their side, the manufacturers and dealers learned that the 
			farmers were not entirely helpless and that to gain their goodwill by 
			fair prices was on the whole wiser than to force them into competition. 
			Thus these ventures resulted in the development of a new tolerance and a 
			new respect between the two traditionally antagonistic classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The social and intellectual stimulus which the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_072" id="Page_072">72</a></span>
			farmers received from the
      movement was probably even more important than any direct political or
      economic results. It is difficult for the present generation to form any
      conception of the dreariness and dullness of farm life half a century ago.
      Especially in the West, where farms were large, opportunities for social
      intercourse were few, and weeks might pass without the farmer seeing any
      but his nearest neighbors. For his wife existence was even more drear. She
      went to the market town less often than he and the routine of her life on
      the farm kept her close to the farmhouse and prevented visits even to her
      neighbors' dwellings. The difficulty of getting domestic servants made the
      work of the farmer's wife extremely laborious; and at that time there were
      none of the modern conveniences which lighten work such as power churns,
      cream separators, and washing-machines. Even more than the husband, the
      wife was likely to degenerate into a drudge without the hope&mdash;and
      eventually without the desire&mdash;of anything better. The church formed,
      to be sure, a means of social intercourse; but according to prevailing
      religious notions the churchyard was not the place nor the Sabbath the
      time for that healthy but unrestrained hilarity which is essential to the
      well-being of man.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_073" id="Page_073">73</a></span>
      Into lives thus circumscribed the Grange came as a liberalizing and
      uplifting influence. Its admission of women into the order on the same
      terms as men made it a real community servant and gave both women and men
      a new sense of the dignity of woman. More important perhaps than any
      change in theories concerning womankind, it afforded an opportunity for
      men and women to work and play together, apparently much to the
      satisfaction and enjoyment of both sexes. Not only in Grange meetings,
      which came at least once a month and often more frequently, but also in
      Grange picnics and festivals the farmers and their wives and children came
      together for joyous human intercourse. Such frequent meetings were bound
      to work a change of heart. Much of man's self-respect arises from the
      esteem of others, and the desire to keep that esteem is certainly a
      powerful agent in social welfare. It was reported that in many communities
      the advent of the Grange created a marked improvement in the dress and
      manners of the members. Crabbed men came out of their shells and grew
      genial; disheartened women became cheerful; repressed children delighted
      in the chance to play with other boys and girls of their own age.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ritual of the Grange, inculcating lessons of 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_074" id="Page_074">74</a></span>
			orderliness, industry, thrift, and temperance, expressed the members' 
			ideals in more dignified and pleasing language than they themselves could 
			have invented. The songs of the Grange gave an opportunity for the 
			exercise of the musical sense of people not too critical of literary 
			quality, when with "spontaneous trills on every tongue," as one of the 
			songs has it, the members varied the ritual with music.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the virtues especially enjoined on Grange members was charity.
      Ceres, Pomona, and Flora, offices of the Grange to be filled only by
      women, were made to represent Faith, Hope, and Charity, respectively; and
      in the ceremony of dedicating the Grange hall these three stood always
      beside the altar while the chaplain read the thirteenth chapter of First
      Corinthians. Not only in theory but in practice did the order proclaim its
      devotion to charitable work. It was not uncommon for members of a local
      Grange to foregather and harvest the crops for a sick brother or help
      rebuild a house destroyed by fire or tornado. In times of drought or
      plague both state and national Granges were generous in donations for the
      sufferers; in 1874, when the Mississippi River overflowed its banks in its
      lower reaches, money and supplies were sent to the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_075" id="Page_075">75</a></span>
			farmers of Louisiana and Alabama; again in the same year relief was sent 
			to those Patrons who suffered from the grasshopper plague west of the 
			Mississippi; and in 1876 money was sent to South Carolina to aid 
			sufferers from a prolonged drought in that State. These charitable deeds, 
			endearing giver and receiver to each other, resulted in a better 
			understanding and a greater tolerance between people of different parts 
			of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meetings of the local Granges were forums in which the members trained
      themselves in public speaking and parliamentary practice. Programs were
      arranged, sometimes with the help of suggestions from officers of the
      state Grange; and the discussion of a wide variety of topics, mostly
      economic and usually concerned especially with the interests of the
      farmer, could not help being stimulating, even if conclusions were
      sometimes reached which were at variance with orthodox political economy.
      The Grange was responsible, too, for a great increase in the number and
      circulation of agricultural journals. Many of these papers were recognized
      as official organs of the order and, by publishing news of the Granges and
      discussing the political and economic phases of the farmers' movement,
      they built up an extensive circulation. Rural 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_076" id="Page_076">76</a></span>
			postmasters everywhere
      reported a great increase in their mails after the establishment of a
      Grange in the vicinity. One said that after the advent of the order there
      were thirty newspapers taken at his office where previously there had been
      but one. Papers for which members or local Granges subscribed were read,
      passed from hand to hand, and thoroughly discussed. This is good evidence
      that farmers were forming the habit of reading. All the Granger laws might
      have been repealed; all the schemes for co&ouml;peration might have come to
      naught; all the moral and religious teachings of the Grange might have
      been left to the church; but if the Granger movement had created nothing
      else than this desire to read, it would have been worth while. For after
      the farmer began to read, he was no longer like deadwood floating in the
      backwaters of the current; he became more like a propelled vessel in
      midstream&mdash;sometimes, to be sure, driven into turbulent waters,
      sometimes tossed about by conflicting currents, but at least making
      progress.

			may have been the causes of the collapse of the Granger movement
      in 1875 and 1876, returning prosperity for the Western farmer was
      certainly not one of them, for the general agricultural depression showed
      no signs of lifting until nearly the end of the decade. During the Granger
      period the farmer attempted to increase his narrow margin of profit or to
      turn a deficit into a profit by decreasing the cost of transportation and
      eliminating the middleman. Failing in this attempt, he decided that the
      remedy for the situation was to be found in increasing the prices for his
      products and checking the appreciation of his debts by increasing the
      amount of money in circulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This demand for currency inflation was by no means new when it was taken
      up by the Western farmers. It had played a prominent part in American
      history from colonial days, especially in 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_078" id="Page_078">78</a></span>
			periods of depression and in the
      less prosperous sections of the ever advancing frontier. During the Civil
      War, inflation was actually accomplished through the issue of over
      $400,000,000 in legal-tender notes known as "greenbacks." No definite time
      for the redemption of these notes was specified, and they quickly declined
      in value as compared with gold. At the close of the war a paper dollar was
      worth only about half its face value in gold. An attempt was made to raise
      the relative value of the greenbacks and to prepare for the resumption of
      specie payments by retiring the paper money from circulation as rapidly as
      possible. This policy meant, of course, a contraction of the volume of
      currency and consequently met with immediate opposition. In February,
      1868, Congress prohibited the further retirement of greenbacks and left to
      the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury the reissue of the
      $44,000,000 which had been retired. Only small amounts were reissued,
      however, until after the panic of 1873; and when Congress attempted, in
      April, 1874, to force a permanent increase of the currency to
      $400,000,000, President Grant vetoed the bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Closely related to the currency problem was that of the medium to be used
      in the payment of the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_079" id="Page_079">79</a></span>
			principal of bonds issued during the Civil War. When
      the bonds were sold, it was generally understood that they would be
      redeemed in gold or its equivalent. Some of the issues, however, were
      covered by no specific declaration to that effect, and a considerable
      sentiment arose in favor of redeeming them with currency, or lawful money,
      as it was called.
    </p>
    <p>
      These questions were not party issues at first, and there was no clear-cut
      division upon them between the two old parties throughout the period. The
      alinement was by class and section rather than by party; and inflationists
      and advocates of the redemption of the bonds in currency were to be found
      not only among the rank and file but also among the leaders of both
      parties. The failure of either the Democrats or the Republicans to take a
      decided stand on these questions resulted, as so often before, in the
      development of third parties which made them the main planks in the new
      platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first attempts at organized political activity in behalf of
      greenbackism came not from the farmers of the West but from the laboring
      men of the East, whose growing class consciousness resulted in the
      organization of the National Labor Union in 1868. Accompanying, if not
      resulting from the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_080" id="Page_080">80</a></span>
			Government's policy of contraction, came a fall of
      prices and widespread unemployment. It is not strange, therefore, that
      this body at once declared itself in favor of inflation. The plan proposed
      was what was known as the "American System of Finance": money was to be
      issued only by the Government and in the form of legal-tender paper
      redeemable only with bonds bearing a low rate of interest, these bonds in
      turn to be convertible into greenbacks at the option of the holder. The
      National Labor Union recommended the nomination of workingmen's candidates
      for offices and made arrangements for the organization of a National Labor
      party. This convened in Columbus in February, 1872, adopted a Greenback
      platform, and nominated David Davis of Illinois as its candidate for the
      presidency. After the nomination of Horace Greeley by the Liberal
      Republicans, Davis declined this nomination, and the executive committee
      of his party then decided that it was too late to name another candidate.
    </p>
    <p>
      This early period of inflation propaganda has been described as "the
      social reform period, or the wage-earners' period of greenbackism, as
      distinguished from the inflationist, or farmers' period that followed."
      The primary objects of the labor 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_081" id="Page_081">81</a></span>
			reformers were, it appears, to lower the rate of interest on money and to 
			reduce taxation by the transformation of the war debt into 
			interconvertible bonds. The farmers, on the other hand, were interested 
			primarily in the expansion of the currency in the hope that this would 
			result in higher prices for their products. It was not until the panic of 
			1873 had intensified the agricultural depression and the Granger movement 
			had failed to relieve the situation that the farmers of the West took hold 
			of greenbackism and made it a major political issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The independent parties of the Granger period, as a rule, were not in
      favor of inflation. Their platforms in some cases demanded a speedy return
      to specie payment. In 1873 Ignatius Donnelly, in a pamphlet entitled
      <i>Facts for the Granges</i>, declared: "There is too much paper money. The
      currency is 
			<i>diluted</i>&mdash;<i>watered</i>&mdash;<i>weakened</i>.&hellip; 
			We have no interest in an inflated money market.&hellip; 
			As we have to sell our wheat at the world's
      price, it is our interest that everything we buy should be at the world's
      price. Specie payments would practically add eighteen cents to the price
      of every bushel of wheat we have to sell!" In Indiana and Illinois,
      however, the independent parties were captured by the Greenbackers, and
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_082" id="Page_082">82</a></span>
      the Indiana party issued the call for the conference at Indianapolis in
      November, 1874, which led to the organization of the National Greenback
      party.
    </p>
    <p>
      This conference was attended by representatives from seven States and
      included several who had been prominent in the Labor Reform movement. "The
      political Moses of the 'New Party,'" according to the Chicago <i>Tribune</i>,
      was James Buchanan of Indianapolis, a lawyer "with an ability and
      shrewdness that compel respect, however much his theories may be ridiculed
      and abused." He was also the editor of the <i>Sun</i>, a weekly paper which
      supported the farmers' movement. The platform committee of the conference
      reported in favor of "a new political organization of the people, by the
      people, and for the people, to restrain the aggressions of combined
      capital upon the rights and interests of the masses, to reduce taxation,
      correct abuses, and to purify all departments of the Government." The most
      important issue before the people was declared to be "the proper solution
      of the money question," meaning thereby the issue of greenbacks
      interconvertible with bonds. A national convention of the party was called
      to meet at Cleveland on March 11, 1875.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_083" id="Page_083">83</a></span>
      The Cleveland convention, attended by representatives of twelve States,
      completed the organization of the Independent party, as it was officially
      named, and made arrangements for the nominating convention. This was held
      at Indianapolis on May 17, 1876, with 240 delegates representing eighteen
      States. Ignatius Donnelly, who had apparently changed his mind on the
      currency question since 1873, was the temporary president. The platform
      contained the usual endorsement of a circulating medium composed of
      legal-tender notes interconvertible with bonds but gave first place to a
      demand for "the immediate and unconditional repeal of the
      specie-resumption act." This measure, passed by Congress in January, 1875,
      had fixed January 1, 1879, as the date when the Government would redeem
      greenbacks at their face value in coin. Although the act made provision
      for the permanent retirement of only a part of the greenbacks from
      circulation, the new party denounced it as a "suicidal and destructive
      policy of contraction." Another plank in the platform, and one of special
      interest in view of the later free silver agitation, was a protest against
      the sale of bonds for the purpose of purchasing silver to be substituted
      for the fractional currency of war times. 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_084" id="Page_084">84</a></span>
			This measure, it was asserted, "although well calculated to enrich owners 
			of silver mines &hellip;  will still further oppress, in taxation, an 
			already overburdened people."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a strong movement in the convention for the nomination of David
      Davis for the presidency, but this seems to have met with opposition from
      Eastern delegates who remembered his desertion of the National Labor
      Reform party in 1872. Peter Cooper of New York was finally selected as the
      candidate. He was a philanthropist rather than a politician and was now
      eighty-five years old. Having made a large fortune as a pioneer in the
      manufacture of iron, he left his business cares to other members of his
      family and devoted himself to the education and elevation of the working
      classes. His principal contribution to this cause was the endowment of the
      famous Cooper Union in New York, where several thousand persons, mostly
      mechanics, attended classes in a variety of technical and educational
      subjects and enjoyed the privileges of a free library and reading room.
      When notified of his nomination, Cooper at first expressed the hope that
      one or both of the old parties might adopt such currency planks as would
      make the new movement unnecessary. Later he 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_085" id="Page_085">85</a></span>
			accepted unconditionally but took no active part in the campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Greenback movement at first made but slow progress in the various
      States. In Indiana and Illinois the existing independent organizations
      became component parts of the new party, although in Illinois, at least,
      quite a number of the former leaders returned to the old parties. In the
      other Western States, however, the third parties of the Granger period had
      gone to pieces or had been absorbed by means of fusion, and new
      organizations had to be created. In Indiana the Independent party
      developed sufficient strength to scare the Republican leaders and to cause
      one of them to write to Hayes: "A bloody-shirt campaign, with money, and
      Indiana is safe; a financial campaign and no money and we are beaten."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Independents do not appear to have made a very vigorous campaign in
      1876. The coffers of the party were as empty as the pockets of the farmers
      who were soon to swell its ranks; and this made a campaign of the usual
      sort impossible. One big meeting was held in Chicago in August, with
      Samuel F. Cary, the nominee for Vice-President, as the principal
      attraction; and this was followed by a torchlight procession. A number of
      papers 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_086" id="Page_086">86</a></span>
			published by men who were active in the movement, such as Buchanan's 
			<i>Indianapolis Star</i>, Noonan's <i>Industrial Age</i> of Chicago, and
      Donnelly's <i>Anti-Monopolist</i> of St. Paul, labored not without avail 
			to spread the gospel among their readers. The most effective means of
      propaganda, however, was probably the Greenback Club. At a conference in
      Detroit in August, 1875, "the organization of Greenback Clubs in every
      State in the Union" was recommended, and the work was carried on under the
      leadership of Marcus M. Pomeroy. "Brick" Pomeroy was a journalist, whose
      sobriquet resulted from a series of <i>Brickdust Sketches</i> of prominent
      Wisconsin men which he published in one of his papers. As the editor of
      <i>Brick Pomeroy's Democrat</i>, a sensational paper published in New 
			York, he had gained considerable notoriety. In 1875, after the failure of 
			this enterprise he undertook to retrieve his broken fortunes by editing a
      Greenback paper in Chicago and by organizing Greenback clubs for which
      this paper served as an organ. Pomeroy also wrote and circulated a series
      of tracts with such alluring titles as <i>Hot Drops</i> and <i>Meat for 
			Men</i>. Several thousand clubs were organized in the Northwest during 
			the next few years, principally in the rural regions, and the secrecy of 
			their 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_087" id="Page_087">87</a></span>
			proceedings aroused the fear that they were advocating communism. The 
			members of the clubs and their leaders constituted, as a matter of fact, 
			the more radical of the Greenbackers. They usually opposed fusion with the 
			Democrats and often refused to follow the regular leaders of the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the election the Greenback ticket polled only about eighty thousand
      votes, or less than one per cent of the total. In spite of the activity of
      former members of the Labor Reform party in the movement, Pennsylvania was
      the only Eastern State in which the new party made any considerable
      showing. In the West over 6000 votes were cast in each of the five 
			States&mdash;Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Iowa, and Kansas. The agrarian 
			aspect of the movement was now uppermost, but the vote of 17,000 polled in 
			Illinois, though the largest of the group, was less than a quarter of the 
			votes cast by the state Independent Reform party in 1874 when railroad 
			regulation had been the dominant issue. Clearly many farmers were not yet 
			convinced of the necessity of a Greenback party. The only tangible 
			achievement of the party in 1876 was the election of a few members of the 
			Illinois Legislature who held the balance between the old parties and were 
			instrumental in sending David Davis to the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_088" id="Page_088">88</a></span>
			United States Senate. This vote, it is interesting to note, kept Davis 
			from serving on the electoral commission and thus probably prevented 
			Tilden from becoming President.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Greenback movement was to find fresh impetus in 1877, a year of
      exceptional unrest and discontent throughout the Union. The agricultural
      depression was even greater than in preceding years, while the great
      railroad strikes were evidence of the distress of the workingmen. This
      situation was reflected in politics by the rapid growth of the Greenback
      party and the reappearance of labor parties with Greenback planks. &sup1;
    </p>
		<div class="footer">
		  <p>
      <a id="footer_6-1" name="footer_6-1"></a> 
			&sup1; In state elections from Massachusetts to Kansas the
     Greenback and labor candidates polled from 5 to 15 per cent
     of the total vote, and in most cases the Greenback vote
     would probably have been much greater had not one or the
     other, and in some cases both, of the old parties
     incorporated part of the Greenback demands in their
     platforms. In Wisconsin, for example, there was little
     difference between Democrats and Greenbackers on the
     currency question, and even the Republicans in their
     platform leaned toward inflation, although the candidates
     declared against it. No general elections were held in 1877
     in some of the States where the Greenback sentiment was most
     pronounced.
    </p>
		</div>
    <p>
      In the following year the new party had an excellent opportunity to
      demonstrate its strength wherever it existed. In February, 1878, a
      conference was held at Toledo for the purpose of welding the various
      political organizations of workingmen 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_089" id="Page_089">89</a></span>
			and advocates of inflation into an
      effective weapon as a single united party. This conference, which was
      attended by several hundred delegates from twenty-eight States, adopted
      "National" as the name of the party, but it was usually known from this
      time on as the Greenback Labor party. The Toledo platform, as the
      resolutions adopted by this conference came to be designated, first
      denounced "the limiting of the legal-tender quality of greenbacks, the
      changing of currency-bonds into coin-bonds, the demonetization of the
      silver dollar, the excepting of bonds from taxation, the contraction of
      the circulating medium, the proposed forced resumption of specie payments,
      and the prodigal waste of the public lands." The resolutions which
      followed demanded the suppression of bank notes and the issue of all money
      by the Government, such money to be full legal-tender at its stamped value
      and to be provided in sufficient quantity to insure the full employment of
      labor and to establish a rate of interest which would secure to labor its
      just reward. Other planks called for the coinage of silver on the same
      basis as that of gold, reservation of the public lands for actual
      settlers, legislative reduction of the hours of labor, establishment of
      labor bureaus, abolition of the contract system of employing 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_090" id="Page_090">90</a></span>
			prison labor, and suppression of Chinese immigration. It is clear that in 
			this platform the interests of labor received full consideration. Just 
			before the conference adjourned it adopted two additional resolutions. 
			One of these, adopted in response to a telegram from General B.&nbsp;F. 
			Butler, denounced the silver bill just passed by Congress because it had 
			been so modified as to limit the amount of silver to be coined. The other, 
			which was offered by "Brick" Pomeroy, declared: "We will not affiliate in 
			any degree with any of the old parties, but in all cases and localities 
			will organize anew &hellip; and &hellip; vote only for men who entirely 
			abandon old party lines and organizations." This attempt to forestall 
			fusion was to be of no avail, as the sequel will show, but Pomeroy and his 
			followers in the Greenback clubs adhered throughout to their declaration.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the elections of 1878, the high-water mark of the movement, about a
      million votes were cast for Greenback candidates. Approximately two-thirds
      of the strength of the party was in the Middle West and one-third in the
      East. That the movement, even in the East, was largely agrarian, is
      indicated by the famous argument of Solon Chase, chairman of the party
      convention in Maine. "Inflate the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_091" id="Page_091">91</a></span>
			currency, and you raise the price of my
      steers and at the same time pay the public debt." "Them steers" gave Chase
      a prominent place in politics for half a decade. The most important
      achievement of the movement at this time was the election to Congress of
      fifteen members who were classified as Nationals&mdash;six from the East,
      six from the Middle West, and three from the South. In most cases these
      men secured their election through fusion or through the failure of one of
      the old parties to make nominations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Easily first among the Greenbackers elected to Congress in 1878 was
      General James B. Weaver of Iowa. When ten years of age, Weaver had been
      taken by his parents to Iowa from Ohio, his native State. In 1854, he
      graduated from a law school in Cincinnati, and for some years thereafter
      practiced his profession and edited a paper at Bloomfield in Davis County,
      Iowa. He enlisted in the army as a private in 1861, displayed great
      bravery at the battles of Donelson and Shiloh, and received rapid
      promotion to the rank of colonel. At the close of the war he received a
      commission as brigadier general by brevet. Weaver ran his first tilt in
      state politics in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain the Republican
      nomination for lieutenant governor 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_092" id="Page_092">92</a></span>
			in 1865. Although an ardent advocate of
      prohibition and of state regulation of railroads, Weaver remained loyal to
      the Republican party during the Granger period and in 1875 was a
      formidable candidate for the gubernatorial nomination. It is said that a
      majority of the delegates to the convention had been instructed in his
      favor, but the railroad and liquor interests succeeded in stampeding the
      convention to Samuel J. Kirkwood, the popular war governor. In the
      following year Weaver took part in the organization of the Independent or
      Greenback party in Iowa and accepted a position on its state committee.
      Though resentment at the treatment which he had received from the
      Republicans may have influenced him to break the old ties, he was
      doubtless sincerely convinced that the Republican party was beyond
      redemption and that the only hope for reform lay in the new party
      movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weaver was gifted with remarkable talent as an orator. His fine face and
      soldierly bearing, his rich sympathetic voice and vivid imagination, made
      him a favorite speaker at soldiers' reunions and in political campaigns.
      Lacking the eccentricities of so many of his third party associates and
      never inclined to go to extremes in his radicalism, he was 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_093" id="Page_093">93</a></span>
			one of the ablest and, from the standpoint of the Republicans, the most 
			dangerous of the Greenback leaders. In Congress Weaver won the respect of 
			his colleagues. Always ready to promote what he believed to be the 
			interests of the common people and especially of the farmers, he espoused 
			the cause of the Oklahoma "boomers," who were opposed by a powerful lobby
      representing the interests of the "cattle barons." He declared that, in a
      choice between bullocks and babies, he would stand for babies, and he
      staged a successful filibuster at the close of a session in order to force
      the consideration of a bill for the opening of part of Oklahoma to
      settlement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preliminaries of the campaign of 1880 were vexed by dissension within
      the ranks of the Greenbackers. In March the radical faction led by Pomeroy
      held a convention in St. Louis which claimed to speak for ten thousand
      Greenback clubs and two million voters. After Stephen D. Dillaye of New
      York had refused the presidential nomination at the hands of this
      convention, it adjourned to meet in Chicago on the 9th of June&mdash;the 
			place and time already selected for the regular convention of the National
      party. One reason for the attitude of this faction appears to have been
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_094" id="Page_094">94</a></span>
      the fear of fusion with the Democrats. The Chicago convention finally
      succeeded in absorbing these malcontents, as well as a group of socialist
      delegates and representatives of various labor organizations who asked to
      be admitted. Dennis Kearney, the notorious sand-lot agitator of California
      was made chief sergeant at arms, and Susan B. Anthony was allowed to give
      a suffrage speech. The platform differed from earlier Greenback documents
      in that it contained no denunciation of the Resumption Act. That was now a
      dead issue, for on January 1, 1879, resumption became an accomplished
      fact, and the paper currency was worth its face value in gold. Apart from
      this the platform was much the same as that adopted at Toledo in 1878,
      with the addition of planks favoring women's suffrage, a graduated income
      tax, and congressional regulation of interstate commerce. On the first
      ballot, General Weaver received a majority of the votes for presidential
      nominee; and B.&nbsp;J. Chambers of Texas was nominated for 
			Vice-President.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Weaver in his letter of acceptance declared it to be his intention
      "to visit the various sections of the Union and talk to the people." This
      he did, covering the country from Arkansas to Maine and from Lake Michigan
      to the Gulf, speaking 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_095" id="Page_095">95</a></span>
			in Faneuil Hall at Boston and in the Cooper Union at
      New York, but spending the greater part of his time in the Southern
      States. He declared that he traveled twenty thousand miles, made fully one
      hundred speeches, shook the hands of thirty thousand people, and was heard
      by half a million. Weaver was the first presidential candidate to conduct
      a campaign of this sort, and the results were not commensurate with his
      efforts. The Greenback vote was only 308,578, about three per cent of the
      total. One explanation of the small vote would seem to be the usual
      disinclination of people to vote for a man who has no chance of election,
      however much they may approve of him and his principles, when they have
      the opportunity to make their votes count in deciding between two other
      candidates. Then, too, the sun of prosperity was beginning at last to
      dissipate the clouds of depression. The crops of corn, wheat, and oats
      raised in 1880 were the largest the country had ever known; and the price
      of corn for once failed to decline as production rose, so that the crop
      was worth half as much again as that of 1878. When the farmer had large
      crops to dispose of at remunerative prices, he lost interest in the
      inflation of the currency.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_096" id="Page_096">96</a></span>
      After 1880 the Greenback party rapidly disintegrated. There was no longer
      any hope of its becoming a major party, in the near future at least, and
      the more conservative leaders began to drift back into the old parties or
      to make plans for fusion with one of them in coming elections. But fusion
      could at best only defer the end. The congressional election of 1882
      clearly demonstrated that the party was moribund. Ten of the Congressmen
      elected in 1880 had been classified as Nationals; of these only one was
      re&euml;lected in 1882, and no new names appear in the list. It is 
			probable, however, that a number of Congressmen classified as Democrats 
			owed their election in part to fusion between the Democratic and Greenback 
			parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last appearance of the Greenbackers in national politics was in the
      presidential election of 1884. In May of that year a convention of "The
      Anti-Monopoly Organization of the United States," held in Chicago, adopted
      a platform voicing a demand for legislative control of corporations and
      monopolies in the interests of the people and nominated General Benjamin
      F. Butler for President. The convention of the Greenback or National party
      met in Indianapolis, and selected Butler as its candidate also. General
      Weaver presided over 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_097" id="Page_097">97</a></span>
			the convention. The platform contained the usual
      demands of the party with the exception of the resolution for the "free
      and unlimited coinage of gold and silver," which was rejected by a vote of
      218 to 164. It would appear that the majority of the delegates preferred
      to rely upon legal-tender paper to furnish the ample supply of money
      desired. General Butler was at this time acting with the Democrats in
      Massachusetts, and his first response was noncommittal. Although he
      subsequently accepted both nominations, he did not make an active
      campaign, and his total popular vote was only 175,370. Butler's personal
      popularity and his labor affiliations brought increased votes in some of
      the Eastern States and in Michigan, but in those Western States where the
      party had been strongest in 1880 and where it had been distinctly a
      farmers' movement there was a great falling off in the Greenback vote.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the forces of agrarian discontent attained national political
      organization for the first time in the Greenback party, its leaders were
      never able to obtain the support of more than a minority of the farmers.
      The habit of voting the Republican or the Democratic ticket, firmly
      established by the Civil War and by Reconstruction, was too 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_098" id="Page_098">98</a></span>
			strong to be
      lightly broken; and many who favored inflation could not yet bring
      themselves to the point of supporting the Greenback party. On the other
      hand there were undoubtedly many farmers and others who felt that the old
      parties were hopelessly subservient to capitalistic interests, who were
      ready to join in radical movements for reform and for the advancement of
      the welfare of the industrial classes, but who were not convinced that the
      structure of permanent prosperity for farmer and workingman could be built
      on a foundation of fiat money. Although the platforms of the Greenbackers
      contained many demands which were soundly progressive, inflation was the
      paramount issue in them; and with this issue the party was unable to
      obtain the support of all the forces of discontent, radicalism, and reform
      which had been engendered by the economic and political conditions of the
      times. The Greenback movement was ephemeral. Failing to solve the problem
      of agricultural depression, it passed away as had the Granger movement
      before it; but the greater farmers' movement of which both were a part
      went on.

      <span class="smcap">An</span> 
			English observer of agricultural conditions in 1893 finds that
      agricultural unrest was not peculiar to the United States in the last
      quarter of the nineteenth century, but existed in all the more advanced
      countries of the world:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      Almost everywhere, certainly in England, France, Germany, Italy,
      Scandinavia, and the United States, the agriculturists, formerly so
      instinctively conservative, are becoming fiercely discontented, declare
      they gained less by civilization than the rest of the community, and are
      looking about for remedies of a drastic nature. In England they are hoping
      for aid from councils of all kinds; in France they have put on protective
      duties which have been increased in vain twice over; in Germany they put
      on and relaxed similar duties and are screaming for them again; in
      Scandinavia&mdash;Denmark more particularly&mdash;they limit the 
			aggregation of land; and in the United States they create organizations 
			like the Grangers, the Farmers' Leagues, and the Populists. &sup1;

      It is to general causes, indeed, that one must turn before trying to find
      the local circumstances which aggravated the unrest in the United States,
      or at least appeared to do so. The application of power&mdash;first steam,
      then electricity&mdash;to machinery had not only vastly increased the
      productivity of mankind but had stimulated invention to still wider
      activity and lengthened the distance between man and that gaunt specter of
      famine which had dogged his footsteps from the beginning. With a
      constantly growing supply of the things necessary for the maintenance of
      life, population increased tremendously: England, which a few centuries
      before had been overcrowded with fewer than four million people, was now
      more bountifully feeding and clothing forty millions. Perhaps, all in all,
      mankind was better off than it had ever been before; yet different groups
      maintained unequal progress. The tillers of the soil as a whole remained
      more nearly in their primitive condition than did the dwellers of the
      city. The farmer, it is true, produced a greater yield of crops, was
      surrounded by more comforts, and was able to enjoy greater leisure than
      his kind had ever done before. The scythe and cradle had been supplanted
      by the mower and reaper; horse harrows, cultivators, and 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
			rakes had
      transferred much of the physical exertion of farming to the draft animals.
      But, after all, the farmer owed less to steam and electricity than the
      craftsman and the artisan of the cities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The American farmer, if he read the census reports, might learn that rural
      wealth had increased from nearly $4,000,000,000 in 1850 to not quite
      $16,000,000,000 in 1890; but he would also discover that in the same
      period urban wealth had advanced from a little over $3,000,000,000 to more
      than $49,000,000,000. Forty years before the capital of rural districts
      comprised more than half that of the whole country, now it formed only
      twenty-five per cent. The rural population had shown a steady
      proportionate decrease: when the first census was taken in 1790, the
      dwellers of the country numbered more than ten times those of the city,
      but at the end of the nineteenth century they formed only about one-third
      of the total. Of course the intelligent farmer might have observed that
      food for the consumption of all could be produced by the work of fewer
      hands, and vastly more bountifully as well, and so he might have explained
      the relative decline of rural population and wealth; but when the average
      farmer saw his sons and his neighbors' sons more and more inclined to seek
      work in town and 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
			leave the farm, he put two and two together and came to
      the conclusion that farming was in a perilous state. He heard the boy who
      had gone to the city boast that his hours were shorter, his toil less
      severe, and his return in money much greater than had been the case on the
      farm; and he knew that this was true. Perhaps the farmer did not realize
      that he had some compensations: greater security of position and a
      reasonable expectation that old age would find him enjoying some sort of
      home, untroubled by the worry which might attend the artisan or
      shopkeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether or not the American farmer realized that the nineteenth century
      had seen a total change in the economic relations of the world, he did
      perceive clearly that something was wrong in his own case. The first and
      most impressive evidence of this was to be found in the prices he received
      for what he had to sell. From 1883 to 1889 inclusive the average price of
      wheat was seventy-three cents a bushel, of corn thirty-six cents, of oats
      twenty-eight cents. In 1890 crops were poor in most of the grain areas,
      while prosperous times continued to keep the consuming public of the
      manufacturing regions able to buy; consequently corn and oats nearly
      doubled in price, and wheat advanced 20 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
			per cent. Nevertheless, such was
      the shortage, except in the case of corn, that the total return was
      smaller than it had been for a year or two before. In 1891 bumper crops of
      wheat, corn, oats, rye, and barley drove the price down on all except
      wheat and rye, but not to the level of 1889. Despite a much smaller
      harvest in 1892 the decline continued, to the intense disgust of the
      farmers of Nebraska and Minnesota who failed to note that the entire
      production of wheat in the world was normal in that year, that
      considerable stores of the previous crop had been held over and that more
      than a third of the yield in the United States was sent forth to compete
      everywhere with the crops of Argentine, Russia, and the other grain
      producing countries. No wonder the average farmer of the Mississippi basin
      was ready to give ear to any one who could suggest a remedy for his ills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cotton, which averaged nearly eleven cents a pound for the decade ending
      in 1890, dropped to less than nine cents in 1891 and to less than eight in
      1892. Cattle, hogs, sheep, horses, and mules brought more in the late than
      in the early eighties, yet these, too, showed a decline about 1890. The
      abnormal war-time price of wool which was more than one dollar a pound in
      October, 1864, dropped 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
			precipitately with peace, rose a little just before
      the panic of 1873, and then declined with almost no reaction until it
      reached thirty-three cents for the highest grade in 1892.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "roaring eighties," with all their superficial appearance of
      prosperity, had apparently not brought equal cheer to all. And then came
      the "heart-breaking nineties." In February, 1893, the Philadelphia and
      Reading Railroad Company failed, a break in the stock market followed, and
      an old-fashioned panic seized the country in its grasp. A period of
      hitherto unparalleled speculative frenzy came thus to an end, and sober
      years followed in which the American people had ample opportunity to
      contemplate the evils arising from their economic debauch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prices of agricultural products continued their downward trend. Wheat
      touched bottom in 1894 with an average price of forty-nine cents; corn,
      two years later, reached twenty-one cents. All the other grains were
      likewise affected. Middling cotton which had sold at eight and a half
      cents a pound in 1893, dropped below seven cents the following year,
      recovered until it reached nearly eight cents in 1896, and was at its
      lowest in 1898 at just under six cents. Of all the marketable products of
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
      the farm, cattle, hay, and hogs alone maintained the price level of the
      decade prior to 1892. Average prices, moreover, do not fully indicate the
      small return which many farmers received. In December, 1891, for instance,
      the average value of a bushel of corn was about forty cents, but in
      Nebraska, on January 1, 1892, corn brought only twenty-six cents. When, a
      few years later, corn was worth, according to the statistics, just over
      twenty-one cents, it was literally cheaper to burn it in Kansas or
      Nebraska than to cart it to town, sell it, and buy coal with the money
      received; and this is just what hundreds of despairing farmers did. Even
      crop shortage did little to increase the price of the grain that was
      raised. When a drought seriously diminished the returns in Ohio, Indiana,
      and Michigan in 1895, the importation from States farther west prevented
      any rise in price.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prices dropped, but the interest on mortgages remained the same. One
      hundred and seventy-four bushels of wheat would pay the interest at 8 per
      cent on a $2000 mortgage in 1888, when the price of wheat was higher than
      it had been for ten years and higher than it was to be again for a dozen
      years. In 1894 or 1895 when the price was hovering around fifty cents, it
      took 320 bushels to pay the same 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
			interest. Frequently the interest was
      higher than 8 per cent, and outrageous commissions on renewals increased
      the burden of the farmer. The result was one foreclosure after another.
      The mortgage shark was identified as the servant of the "Wall Street
      Octopus," and between them there was little hope for the farmer. In
      Kansas, according to a contemporary investigator, &sup1; "the whole western
      third of the State was settled by a boom in farm lands. Multitudes of
      settlers took claims without means of their own, expecting to pay for the
      land from the immediate profits of farming. Multitudes of them mortgaged
      the land for improvements, and multitudes more expended the proceeds of
      mortgages in living. When it was found that the proceeds of farming in
      that part of the State were very uncertain, at best, the mortgages became
      due. And in many instances those who had been nominally owners remained
      upon the farms as tenants after foreclosure. These are but the natural
      effects in reaction from a tremendous boom." In eastern Kansas, where
      settlement was older, the pressure of hard times was withstood with less
      difficulty. It was in western Kansas, by the way, that Populism had its
      strongest following; and, after the election 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
			of 1892, a movement to
      separate the State into two commonwealths received serious consideration.

		</div>
    <p>
      Even more inexorable than the holder of the mortgage or his agent was the
      tax collector. It was easy to demonstrate that the farmer, with little or
      nothing but his land, his stock, and a meager outfit of implements and
      furniture, all readily to be seen and assessed, paid taxes higher in
      proportion to his ability to pay than did the business man or the
      corporation. Although his equity in the land he owned might be much less
      than its assessed value, he was not allowed to make any deduction for
      mortgages. The revenue of the Federal Government was raised wholly by
      indirect taxes levied principally upon articles of common consumption; and
      the farmer and other people of small means paid an undue share of the
      burden in the form of higher prices demanded for commodities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Low prices for his produce, further depressed by the rapacity of the
      railroads and the other intermediaries between the producer and the
      consumer, mortgages with high interest rates, and an inequitable system of
      taxation formed the burden of the farmer's complaint during the last two
      decades of the nineteenth century. These grievances and all sorts of
      remedies proposed for them were discussed 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
			in farmers' gatherings, in
      agricultural weeklies, even in city dailies, and ultimately in legislative
      chambers. Investigations demonstrated that, even when reduced to a
      minimum, the legitimate grounds for complaint were extensive; and the
      resultant reports suggested a variety of remedies. Generally, however,
      popular sentiment swung around again to the tack it had taken in the late
      seventies: the real cure for all the evils was more money. Wall Street and
      the national banks could suck the blood from the western community because
      of their monopoly of the money supply. According to one irate editor, "Few
      people are aware of the boundless advantages that the national banks have
      under our present accursed system. They have usurped the credit of the
      people and are fattening a thousand-fold annually from the unlimited
      resources at their command." Another editor wrote:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      We find the following printed card on our desk: "The last report of the
      Secretary of the Treasury shows the banks as loaning $1,970,022,687"! Four
      times the amount of money there is to loan. Four interests in every
      dollar! They are drawing from the people enough to run the National
      Government. How long will it take them to gather in all the money of the
      nation? This does not include the amounts loaned by state, private, and
      savings banks. Add to this the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
			billions of dollars of other loans and
      think if it is any wonder times are hard. Will the American people never
      wake up to the fact that they are being pauperized? Four people are paying
      interest upon each dollar you have in your pocket&mdash;if you have any.
      Wake up! Wake up!
    </p>
		</blockquote>
    <p>
		
      Whatever the ultimate effects of an inflated and consequently depreciated
      currency might be, the debtor class, to which a large portion of the
      Western farmers belonged, would obviously benefit immediately by the
      injection of large quantities of money into the circulating medium. The
      purchasing power of money would be lower; hence the farmer would receive
      more in dollars and cents and would be in a better position to pay his
      standing debts. Whether or not the rise in the prices of his products
      would be offset or more than offset by the increased prices which he would
      have to pay for the things he purchased would depend upon the relative
      rate at which different commodities adjusted themselves to the new scale
      of money value. In the end, of course, other things being equal, there
      would be a return of old conditions; but the farmers did not look so far
      ahead. Hence it was that less attention was paid to taxation, to railroad
      rates and discriminations, to elevator companies, to 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
			grain gamblers, or to
      corporations as such; and the main force of the agrarian movements from
      1875 onward was exerted, first for an increased paper currency and then
      for free silver.

      <a href="#Contents">CHAPTER VIII.</a>
    </h2>
    <p class="chaptertitle">The Farmer's Alliance</p>
		
		
    <p class="noindent">
      <span class="smcap">The</span> hope of welding the farmers into an 
			organization which would enable them to present a united front to their 
			enemies and to work together for the promotion of their 
			interests&mdash;social, economic, and political&mdash;was too alluring 
			to be allowed to die out with the decline of the Patrons of Husbandry. 
			Farmers who had experienced the benefits of the Grange, even though 
			they had deserted it in its hour of trial, were easily induced to
      join another organization embodying all its essential features but
      proposing to avoid its mistakes. The conditions which brought about the
      rapid spread of the Grange in the seventies still prevailed; and as soon
      as the reaction from the Granger movement was spent, orders of farmers
      began to appear in various places and to spread rapidly throughout the
      South and West. This second movement for agricultural organization
      differed from the first in that it sprang 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span> 
			from the soil, as it were, and, like Topsy, "just growed" instead of being 
			deliberately planned and put into operation by a group of founders.
    </p>
    <p>
      A local farmers' club or alliance was organized in 1874 or 1875 in the
      frontier county of Lampasas, Texas, for mutual protection against horse
      thieves and land sharks and for co&ouml;peration in the rounding up of 
			strayed stock and in the purchase of supplies. That it might accomplish 
			its purposes more effectively, the club adopted a secret ritual of three
      degrees; and it is said that at first this contained a formula for
      catching horse thieves. Affiliated lodges were soon established in
      neighboring communities, and in 1878 a Grand State Alliance was organized.
      Some one connected with this movement must have been familiar with the
      Grange, for the <i>Declaration of Purposes</i> adopted by the State 
			Alliance in 1880 is but a crude paraphrase of the declaration adopted by 
			the earlier order at St. Louis in 1874. These promising beginnings were 
			quickly wrecked by political dissension, particularly in connection with 
			the Greenback movement, and the first State Alliance held its last meeting 
			in 1879. In that year, however, a member of the order who removed to
      Poolville in Parker County, Texas, organized there a distinctly
      non-partisan alliance. 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span> 
			From this new center the movement spread more
      rapidly; a second Grand State Alliance was organized; and the order grew
      with such rapidity that by 1886 there were nearly three thousand local
      lodges in the State. The social aspect was prominent in the Alliance
      movement in Texas from the beginning. Women were admitted to full
      membership, and negroes were excluded. In 1882 the three degrees of the
      ritual were combined into one so that all members might be on the same
      footing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The early minutes of the State Alliance indicate that the rounding up of
      estrays was the most important practical feature of the order at that
      time, but in a few years this was overshadowed by co&ouml;peration. Trade
      agreements were made with dealers, joint stock stores and Alliance
      cotton-yards were established, and finally a state exchange was organized
      with a nominal capital of half a million dollars to handle the business of
      the members. All the difficulties which the Grange had encountered in its
      attempts at co&ouml;peration beset the Alliance ventures: dissension was 
			spread by merchants and commission men fighting for their livelihood; 
			mistakes were made by agents and directors; too much was attempted at 
			once; and in a few years the house of cards tumbled to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span> 
      While its business ventures were still promising, the Texas Alliance came
      near being wrecked once more on the shoals of politics. The state meeting
      in August, 1886, adopted an elaborate set of "Demands," which included
      higher taxation of lands held for speculative purposes, prohibition of
      alien land ownership, laws to "prevent the dealing in futures of all
      agricultural products," full taxation of railroad property, "the rapid
      extinguishment of the public debt of the United States, by operating the
      mints to their fullest capacity in coining silver and gold, and the
      tendering of the same without discrimination to the public creditors," the
      issue of legal tender notes on a per capita basis and their substitution
      for bank notes, a national bureau of labor statistics, an interstate
      commerce law, and the abolition of the contract system of employing
      convicts. Provision was made for a committee of three to press these
      demands upon Congress and the State Legislature. At the close of the
      meeting, some of the members, fearing that the adoption of this report
      would lead to an attempt to establish a new political party, held another
      meeting and organized a rival State Alliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Considerable confusion prevailed for a few months; the president and
      vice-president of the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span> 
			regular State Alliance resigned, and the whole order
      seemed on the verge of disruption. At this point there appeared on the
      stage the man who was destined not only to save the Alliance in Texas but
      also to take the lead in making it a national organization&mdash;C.&nbsp;W.
      Macune, the chairman of the executive committee. Assuming the position of
      acting president, Macune called a special session of the State Alliance to
      meet in January, 1887. At this meeting the constitution was amended to
      include a declaration that it was the purpose of the order "to labor for
      the education of the agricultural classes in the science of economical
      government, in a strictly nonpartisan spirit"; and attention was then
      directed to a plan for "the organization of the cotton belt of America."
      The first step in this direction was taken in the same month when the
      Texas Alliance joined with the Farmers' Union of Louisiana and formed the
      National Farmers' Alliance and Co&ouml;perative Union of America. &sup1;
    </p>
		<div class="footer">
		  <p>
      <a id="footer_8-1" name="footer_8-1"></a> 
			&sup1; The Farmers' Union was the outgrowth of an open farmers'
     club organized in Lincoln Parish, Louisiana, in 1880. In
     1885 this was transformed into a secret society with a
     ritual modeled after that of the Grange and with a
     constitution adapted from the constitution used by the Texas
     alliances. Before the year was over the order spread into
     the adjoining parishes and a state union was established.
    </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Macune, who was elected president of the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span> 
			national body, at once sent organizers into most of the Southern States; 
			and local alliances, followed rapidly by state organization, appeared in 
			State after State. When the next meeting was held in October, 1887, 
			delegates were present from nine Southern States. &sup1; The "Demands" 
			adopted at this meeting were very like those which had split the Texas 
			Alliance in the preceding year, with the addition of sections calling 
			for the reduction of the tariff to a revenue basis, a graduated income 
			tax, promotion of industrial and agricultural education, restriction of 
			immigration, and popular election of United States senators.
    </p>
		<div class="footer">
		  <p>
      <a id="footer_8-2" name="footer_8-2"></a> 
			&sup1; By December, 1888, it was claimed that there were 10,000
      alliances in 16 States with a total membership of about
      400,000. It was evident that the organization of the farmers
      of the cotton belt was rapidly being consummated.
    </p>
		</div>
    <p>
      As the Alliance spread into Arkansas and some of the adjoining States, it
      encountered another farmers' association of a very similar character and
      purpose. The Agricultural Wheel, as it was known, originated in a local
      club in Prairie County, Arkansas, in 1882, and soon expanded into a
      state-wide organization. After amalgamating with another agricultural
      order, known as the Brothers of Freedom, the Wheel began to roll into the
      adjoining States. In 1886 delegates from Tennessee and 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span> 
			Kentucky attended
      the meeting of the Arkansas State Wheel and took part in the organization
      of the National Agricultural Wheel. &sup1; When the National Wheel held its
      first annual meeting in November, 1887, eight state organizations had been
      established, all in the Southwest, with a total membership of half a
      million.
    </p>
		<div class="footer">
		  <p>
      <a id="footer_8-3" name="footer_8-3"></a> 
			&sup1; Some difficulty was occasioned at this meeting by the
     question of admitting negroes to the order, but this was
     finally settled by making provision for separate lodges for
     colored members.
    </p>
		</div>
    <p>
      With two great orders of farmers expanding in much the same territory and
      having practically identical objects, the desirability of union was
      obvious. The subject was discussed at meetings of both bodies, and
      committees of conference were appointed. Both organizations finally
      convened in December, 1888, at Meridian, Mississippi, and appointed a
      joint committee to work out the details of amalgamation. The outcome was a
      new constitution, which was accepted by each body acting separately and
      was finally ratified by the state organizations. The combined order was to
      be known as the Farmers' and Laborers' Union of America.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this development had been going on in the South, another movement,
      somewhat different in character and quite independent in origin, had been
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span> 
      launched by the farmers of the Northwest. The founder of the National
      Farmers' Alliance, or the Northwestern Alliance, as it was called to
      distinguish it from the Southern organization, was Milton George, editor
      of the <i>Western Rural</i> of Chicago, who had been instrumental in 
			organizing a local alliance in Cook County. This Alliance began issuing 
			charters to other locals, and in October, at the close of a convention in 
			Chicago attended by about "five hundred, representing alliances, granges, 
			farmers' clubs, etc.," a national organization was formed. The 
			constitution adopted at this time declared the object of the order to be 
			"to unite the farmers of the United States for their protection against 
			class legislation, and the encroachments of concentrated capital and the 
			tyranny of monopoly; &hellip; to oppose, in our respective political 
			parties, the election of any candidate to office, state or national, who 
			is not thoroughly in sympathy with the farmers' interests; to demand that 
			the existing political parties shall nominate farmers, or those who are in 
			sympathy with them, for all offices within the gift of the people, and to 
			do everything in a legitimate manner that may serve to benefit the 
			producer." The specific measures for which the promoters of the 
			Northwestern Alliance intended 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span> 
			to work were set forth in a platform adopted at the second annual meeting 
			in Chicago, October 5, 1881, which demanded: equal taxation of all 
			property, including deduction of the amount of mortgages from assessments 
			of mortgaged property; "a just income tax"; reduction of salaries of
      officials and their election instead of appointment, so far as
      practicable; regulation of interstate commerce; reform of the patent laws;
      and prevention of the adulteration of food. "The combination and
      consolidation of railroad capital &hellip; in the maintenance of an oppressive
      and tyrannical transportation system" was particularly denounced, and the
      farmers of the country were called upon to organize "for systematic and
      persistent action" for "the emancipation of the people from this terrible
      oppression."

      The Northwestern Alliance did not attempt co&ouml;peration in business so
      extensively as did its Southern contemporaries, but a number of Alliance
      grain elevators were established in Minnesota and Dakota, co&ouml;perative
      creameries flourished in Illinois, and many of the alliances appointed
      agents to handle produce and purchase supplies for the members. It was in
      the field of politics, however, that the activity of the order was most
      notable. The 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span> 
			methods by which the farmers of the Northwest attempted to
      use their organizations for political ends are well illustrated by the
      resolutions adopted at the annual meeting of the Minnesota State Alliance
      in 1886 which declared that "the Alliance, while not a partisan
      association, is political in the sense that it seeks to correct the evils
      of misgovernment through the ballot-box," and called upon all the
      producers of the State "to unite with us at the ballot-box next November
      to secure a legislature that will work in the interests of the many
      against the exactions of the few." The specific demands included state
      regulation of railroads, free coinage of silver, reduction of the tariff
      to a revenue basis, revision of the patent laws, high taxation of
      oleomargarine, and reduction of the legal rate of interest from 10 to 8
      per cent. The secretary was directed to forward copies of these
      resolutions to federal and state officers and to the delegation of the
      State in Congress; and the members of local alliances were "urged to
      submit this platform of principles to every candidate for the legislature
      in their respective districts, and to vote as a unit against every man who
      refuses to publicly subscribe his name to the same and pledge himself, if
      elected, to live up to it."
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span> 
      The resolutions adopted by the National Alliance in 1887 show that the
      political purposes of the order had become considerably more comprehensive
      than they were when it was getting under way in 1881. First place was now
      given to a plank favoring the free coinage of silver and the issuance of
      "all paper money direct to the people." The demand for railroad regulation
      was accompanied by a statement that "the ultimate solution of the
      transportation problem may be found in the ownership and operation by the
      Government of one or more transcontinental lines"; and the immediate
      acquisition of the Union Pacific, then in financial difficulties, was
      suggested. Other resolutions called for government ownership and operation
      of the telegraph, improvement of waterways, restriction of the liquor
      traffic, industrial education in the public schools, restoration of
      agricultural colleges "to the high purpose of their creation," and popular
      election of Senators. The national body does not appear to have attempted,
      at this time, to force its platform upon candidates for office; but it
      urged "farmers throughout the country to aid in the work of immediate
      organization, that we may act in concert for our own and the common good."
    </p>
    <p>
      The culmination of this general movement for 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span> 
			the organization of the farmers of the country came in 1889 and 1890. The 
			Farmers' and Laborers' Union and the Northwestern Alliance met at St. 
			Louis on December 3, 1889. The meeting of the Southern organization, 
			which was renamed the National Farmers' Alliance and Industrial Union, 
			was attended by about a hundred delegates representing Indiana, Kansas, 
			and every Southern State from Maryland to Texas, with the exception of 
			West Virginia. The purpose of the two orders in holding their meetings at 
			the same time and place was obviously to effect some sort of union, and 
			committees of conference were at once appointed. Difficulties soon 
			confronted these committees: the Southern Alliance wanted to effect a 
			complete merger but insisted upon retention of the secret features and the 
			exclusion of negroes, at least from the national body; the Northwestern 
			Alliance preferred a federation in which each organization might retain 
			its identity. Arrangements were finally made for future conferences to 
			effect federation but nothing came of them. The real obstacles seem to 
			have been differences of policy with reference to political activity and 
			a survival of sectional feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the failure of the movement for union, the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span> 
			Southern Alliance began
      active work in the Northern States; and when the Supreme Council, as the
      national body was now called, held its next meeting at Ocala, Florida, in
      December, 1890, delegates were present from state alliances of seven
      Northern and Western States, in addition to those represented at the St.
      Louis meeting. The Farmers' Mutual Benefit Association, a secret order
      with about two hundred thousand members, had a committee in attendance at
      this meeting, and the Colored Farmers' Alliance, which had been founded in
      Texas in 1886 and claimed a membership of over a million, held its
      national meeting at the same time and place. Plans were formulated for a
      federation of these three bodies, and of such other farmers' and laborers'
      associations as might join with them, to the end that all might work
      unitedly for legislation in the interests of the industrial classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Signs of approaching dissolution of the Alliance movement were already
      apparent at the Ocala meeting. The finances of the Southern Alliance had
      been so badly managed that there was a deficit of about $6000 in the
      treasury of the Supreme Council. This was due in part to reckless
      expenditure and in part to difficulties in collecting dues from the state
      organizations. Discord had arisen, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span> 
			moreover, from the political campaign of 1890, and an investigating 
			committee expressed its disapproval of the actions of the officers in 
			connection with a senatorial contest in Georgia. The decline of the 
			Southern Alliance after 1890 was even more rapid than that of the Grange 
			had been. The failure of many of the co&ouml;perative ventures contributed 
			to this decline; but complications and dissensions resulting from the 
			establishment of a new political party which took over the Alliance 
			platform, were principally responsible. The Northwestern Alliance 
			continued for a few years, practically as an adjunct to the new party but 
			it, too, lost rapidly in membership and influence. With the year 1890 
			interest shifts from social to political organization, from Alliances to 
			Populism.

      <span class="smcap">Alliances</span>, wheels, leagues&mdash;all the 
			agrarian organizations which multiplied during the eighties&mdash;gave 
			tangible form to the underlying unrest created by the economic conditions 
			of that superficially prosperous decade. Only slowly, however, did there 
			develop a feeling that a new political party was necessary in order to 
			apply the remedies which, it was believed, would cure some if not all the 
			ills of the agricultural class. Old party ties were still strong. Only 
			with reluctance could the Republican or Democrat of long standing bring 
			himself to depart from the familiar fold. Then, too, the recent 
			ignominious failures of the Greenback party might well cool the ardor of 
			all but the most sanguine advocates of a third party movement. Among the 
			leaders of the agrarian organizations were many, moreover, who foresaw 
			that to become involved in partisan politics 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
			could mean nothing less than the defeat of all their original
      purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      One disappointment after another, however, made it apparent that little
      was to be expected from the Republican or the Democratic party. Trust in
      individual politicians proved equally vain, since promises easily made
      during a hot campaign were as easily forgotten after the battle was over.
      One speaker before a state convention of the Northwest Alliance put into
      words what many were thinking: "There may be some contingencies when you
      may have to act politically. If other parties will not nominate men
      friendly to your interest, then your influence will have to be felt in
      some way or you may as well disband. If all parties nominate your enemies,
      then put some of your own friends into the race and then stand by them as
      a Christian stands by his religion." In other words, if nothing was to be
      gained by scattering votes among the candidates of the old parties,
      independent action remained the only course. Hence it was that the late
      eighties saw the beginnings of another party of protest, dominated by the
      farmers and so formidable as to cause the machine politicians to realize
      that a new force was abroad in the land.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
      After the Greenback party lost the place it had for a fleeting moment
      obtained, labor once more essayed the r&ocirc;le of a third party. In 
			1886, for instance, the Knights of Labor and the trades unions, for once 
			co&ouml;perating harmoniously, joined forces locally with the moribund 
			Greenbackers and with farmers' organizations and won notable successes at 
			the polls in various parts of the Union, particularly in the Middle 
			Atlantic and Western States. Emboldened by such victories, the 
			discontented farmers were induced to cast in their lot with labor; and for 
			the next few years, the nation saw the manifestoes of a party which 
			combined the demands of labor and agriculture in platforms constructed not 
			unlike a crazy-quilt, with Henry George, James Buchanan, and Alson J. 
			Streeter presiding at the sewing-bee and attempting to fit into the 
			patchwork the diverse and frequently clashing shades of opinion 
			represented in the party. In 1888, Streeter, ex-president of the 
			Northwestern Alliance, was nominated for President on the Union Labor 
			ticket and received 146,935 votes in 27 of the 38 States. Despite its 
			name and some support from the Eastern workers, the new party was 
			predominantly Western: more than half of its total vote was polled in 
			Kansas, Texas, Missouri, and Arkansas. In the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
			local elections of 1889 and 1890 the party still appeared but was 
			obviously passing off the stage to make way for a greater attraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meager vote for Streeter in 1888 demonstrated that the organized
      farmers were yet far from accepting the idea of separate political action.
      President Macune of the Southern Alliance probably voiced the sentiments
      of most of that order when he said in his address to the delegates at
      Shreveport in 1887: "Let the Alliance be a business organization for
      business purposes, and as such, necessarily secret, and as secret,
      necessarily non-political." &sup1; Even the Northwestern Alliance had 
			given no sign of official approval to the political party in which so 
			many of its own members played a conspicuous part.
    </p>
		<div class="footer">
		  <p>
      <a id="footer_9-1" name="footer_9-1"></a> 
			&sup1; At the next annual meeting, in December, 1888, no change
     in policy was enunciated: the plan for a national organ,
     unanimously adopted by the Alliance, provided that it should
     be "strictly non-partisan in politics and non-sectarian in
     religion."
    </p>
		</div>
    <p>
      But after the election of 1888, those who had continued to put their trust
      in non-political organizations gradually awoke to the fact that neither
      fulminations against transportation abuses, monopolies, and the protective
      tariff, nor the lobbying of the Southern Alliance in Washington had
      produced reforms. Even Macune was moved to say at 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
			the St. Louis session in December, 1889: "We have reached a period in the 
			history of our Government when confidence in our political leaders and 
			great political organizations is almost destroyed, and estrangement 
			between them and the people is becoming more manifest every day." Yet 
			the formation of a new party under the auspices of the Alliance was 
			probably not contemplated at this time, except possibly as a last resort, 
			for the Alliance agreed to "support for office only such men as can be 
			depended upon to enact these principles into statute laws, uninfluenced 
			by party caucus." Although the demands framed at this St. Louis 
			convention read like a party platform and, indeed, became the basis of 
			the platform of the People's Party in 1892, they were little more than a 
			restatement of earlier programs put forth by the Alliance and the Wheel. 
			They called for the substitution of greenbacks for national bank notes, 
			laws to "prevent the dealing in futures of all agricultural and mechanical 
			productions," free and unlimited coinage of silver, prohibition of alien 
			ownership of land, reclamation from the railroads of lands held by them 
			in excess of actual needs, reduction and equalization of taxation, the 
			issue of fractional paper currency for use in the mails, and, finally, 
			government ownership 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
			and operation of the means of communication and transportation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The real contribution which this meeting made to the agrarian movement was
      contained in the report of the committee on the monetary system, of which
      C.&nbsp;W. Macune was chairman. This was the famous sub-treasury scheme, soon
      to become the paramount issue with the Alliance and the Populists in the
      South and in some parts of the West. The committee proposed "that the
      system of using certain banks as United States depositories be abolished,
      and in place of said system, establish in every county in each of the
      States that offers for sale during the one year $500,000 worth of farm
      products&mdash;including wheat, corn, oats, barley, rye, rice, tobacco,
      cotton, wool, and sugar, all together&mdash;a sub-treasury office." In
      connection with this office there were to be warehouses or elevators in
      which the farmers might deposit their crops, receiving a certificate of
      the deposit showing the amount and quality, and a loan of United States
      legal tender paper equal to eighty per cent of the local current value of
      the products deposited. The interest on this loan was to be at the rate of
      one per cent per annum; and the farmer, or the person to whom he might
      sell his certificate, was to be allowed one year 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
			in which to redeem the
      property; otherwise it would be sold at public auction for the
      satisfaction of the debt. This project was expected to benefit the farmers
      in two ways: it would increase and make flexible the volume of currency in
      circulation; and it would enable them to hold their crops in anticipation
      of a rise in price.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Northwestern Alliance also hesitated to play the r&ocirc;le of a third
      party, but it adopted a program which was virtually a party platform. In
      place of the sub-treasury scheme as a means of increasing the volume of
      currency in circulation and at the same time enabling the farmer to borrow
      money at low rates of interest, this organization favored the
      establishment of a land loan bureau operated by the Government. Legal
      tender currency to the amount of $100,000,000 or more if necessary, was to
      be placed at the disposal of this bureau for loans upon the security of
      agricultural land in amounts not to exceed one-half the value of the land
      and at an interest rate of two per cent per annum. These loans might run
      for twenty years but were to be payable at any time at the option of the
      borrower.
    </p>
    <p>
      With two strong organizations assuming all the functions of political
      parties, except the nomination of candidates, the stage was set in 1890
      for a 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
			drama of unusual interest. One scene was laid in Washington, where
      in the House and Senate and in the lobbies the sub-treasury scheme was
      aired and argued. Lending their strength to the men from the mining
      States, the Alliance men aided the passage of the Silver Purchase Act, the
      nearest approach to free silver which Congress could be induced to make.
      By the familiar practice of "logrolling," the silverites prevented the
      passage of the McKinley tariff bill until the manufacturers of the East
      were willing to yield in part their objections to silver legislation. But
      both the tariff and the silver bill seemed to the angry farmers of the
      West mere bones thrown to the dog under the table. They had demanded <em>free</em>
      silver and had secured a mere increase in the amount to be purchased; they
      had called for a downward revision of the duties upon manufactured
      products and had been given more or less meaningless "protection" of their
      farm produce; they had insisted upon adequate control of the trusts and
      had been presented with the Sherman Act, a law which might or might not
      curb the monopolies under which they believed themselves crushed. All the
      unrest which had been gathering during the previous decade, all the venom
      which had been distilled by fourteen cent corn and ten 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
			per cent interest,
      all the blind striving to frustrate the industrial consolidation which the
      farmer did not understand but feared and hated, found expression in the
      political campaign of 1890.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Alliance suited its political activities to local necessities. In many
      of the Southern States, notably Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas,
      Alliance men took possession of the Democratic conventions and forced both
      the incorporation of their demands into the platforms and the nomination
      of candidates who agreed to support those demands. The result was the
      control of the legislatures of five Southern States by members or
      supporters of the order and the election of three governors, one United
      States Senator, and forty-four Congressmen who championed the principles
      of the Alliance. In the West the Alliance worked by itself and, instead of
      dominating an old party, created a new one. It is true that the order did
      not formally become a political party; but its officers took the lead in
      organizing People's, Independent, or Industrial parties in the different
      States, the membership of which was nearly identical with that of the
      Alliance. Nor was the farmer alone in his efforts. Throughout the whole
      country the prices of manufactured articles had suddenly risen, and
      popular 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
			opinion, fastening upon the McKinley tariff as the cause,
      manifested itself in a widespread desire to punish the Republican party.
    </p>
    <p>
      The events of 1890 constituted not only a political revolt but a social
      upheaval in the West. Nowhere was the overturn more complete than in
      Kansas. If the West in general was uneasy, Kansas was in the throes of a
      mighty convulsion; it was swept as by the combination of a tornado and a
      prairie fire. As a sympathetic commentator of later days puts it, "It was
      a religious revival, a crusade, a pentecost of politics in which a tongue
      of flame sat upon every man, and each spake as the spirit gave him
      utterance." &sup1; All over the State, meetings were held in schoolhouses,
      churches, and public halls. Alliance picnics were all-day expositions of
      the doctrines of the People's Party. Up and down the State, and from
      Kansas City to Sharon Springs, Mary Elizabeth Lease, "Sockless" Jerry
      Simpson, Anna L. Diggs, William A. Peffer, Cyrus Corning, and twice a
      score more, were in constant demand for lectures, while lesser lights
      illumined the dark places when the stars of the first magnitude were
      scintillating elsewhere.

      Mrs. Lease, who is reported to have made 160 speeches in the summer and
      autumn of 1890, was a curiosity in American politics. Of Irish birth and
      New York upbringing, she went to Kansas and, before she was twenty years
      old, married Charles L. Lease. Twelve years later she was admitted to the
      bar. At the time of the campaign of 1890 she was a tall, mannish-looking,
      but not unattractive woman of thirty-seven years, the mother of four
      children. She was characterized by her friends as refined, magnetic, and
      witty; by her enemies of the Republican party as a hard, unlovely shrew.
      The hostile press made the most of popular prejudice against a woman stump
      speaker and attempted by ridicule and invective to drive her from the
      stage. But Mrs. Lease continued to talk. She it was who told the Kansas
      farmers that what they needed was to "raise less corn and more 
			<span class="smcap">hell</span>!"

      A typical feature of this campaign in Kansas was the contest between Jerry
      Simpson and Colonel James R. Hallowell for a seat in Congress. Simpson
      nicknamed his fastidious opponent "Prince Hal" and pointed to his silk
      stockings as an evidence of aristocracy. Young Victor Murdock, then a cub
      reporter, promptly wrote a story to the effect that Simpson himself wore
      no socks at all. "Sockless Jerry," "Sockless Simpson," and then "Sockless
      Socrates" were sobriquets then and thereafter applied to the stalwart
      Populist. Simpson was at this time forty-eight years old, a man with a
      long, square-jawed face, his skin tanned by 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
			exposure on shipboard, in the
      army, and on the farm, and his mustache cut in a straight line over a
      large straight mouth. He wore clerical eyeglasses and unclerical clothes.
      His opponents called him clownish; his friends declared him Lincolnesque.
      Failing to make headway against him by ridicule, the Republicans arranged
      a series of joint debates between the candidates; but the audience at the
      first meeting was so obviously partial to Simpson that Hallowell refused
      to meet him again. The supporters of the "sockless" statesman, though less
      influential and less prosperous than those of Hallowell, proved more
      numerous and triumphantly elected him to Congress. In Washington he
      acquitted himself creditably and was perhaps disappointingly conventional
      in speech and attire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outcome of this misery, disgust, anger, and hatred on the part of the
      people of Kansas focused by shrewd common sense and rank demagogism, was
      the election of five Populist Congressmen and a large Populist majority in
      the lower house of the state legislature; the Republican state officers
      were elected by greatly reduced majorities. In Nebraska, the People's
      Independent party obtained a majority of the members of the legislature
      and reduced the Republican party to third place in 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
			the vote for governor,
      the victory going to the Democrats by a very small plurality. The South
      Dakota Independent party, with the president of the state Alliance as its
      standard bearer, was unable to defeat the Republican candidates for state
      offices but obtained the balance of power in the legislature. In Indiana,
      Michigan, and Minnesota, the new party movement manifested considerable
      strength, but, with the exception of one Alliance Congressman from
      Minnesota and a number of legislators, the fruits of its activity were
      gathered by the Democrats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the results of the new party movements in the Western States in 1890
      should be included the election of two United States Senators, neither of
      whom was a farmer, although both were ardent advocates of the farmers'
      cause. In South Dakota, where no one of the three parties had a majority
      in the legislature, the Reverend James H. Kyle, the Independent candidate,
      was elected to the United State Senate, when, after thirty-nine ballots,
      the Democrats gave him their votes. Kyle, who was only thirty-seven years
      old at this time, was a Congregational minister, a graduate of Oberlin
      College and of Alleghany Theological Seminary. He had held pastorates in
      Colorado and South 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
			Dakota, and at the time of his election was financial
      agent for Yankton College. A radical Fourth of July oration which he
      delivered at Aberdeen brought him into favor with the Alliance, and he was
      elected to the state senate on the Independent ticket in 1890. Prior to
      this election Kyle had been a Republican.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other senatorial victory was gained in Kansas, where the choice fell
      on William A. Peffer, whose long whiskers made him a favorite object of
      ridicule and caricature in Eastern papers. He was born in Pennsylvania in
      1831, and as a young man had gone to California during the gold boom.
      Returning after two years with a considerable sum of money, he engaged in
      farming first in Indiana and then in Missouri. When the Civil War began,
      his avowed Unionist sentiments got him into trouble; and in 1862 he moved
      to Illinois, where after a few months he enlisted in the army. At the
      close of the war he settled in Tennessee and began the practice of law,
      which he had been studying at intervals for a number of years. He removed
      in 1870 to Kansas, where he played some part in politics as a Republican,
      was elected to the state senate, and served as a delegate to the national
      convention of 1880. After a number of newspaper 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
			ventures he became the editor of the <i>Kansas Farmer</i> of Topeka in 
			1880 and continued in that position until he was elected to the United 
			States Senate. He was a member of the Knights of Labor and was an ardent 
			prohibitionist and, above all, an advocate of currency inflation.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the elections of November, 1890, came definite action in the
      direction of forming a new national party. The Citizens' Alliance, a
      secret political organization of members of the Southern Alliance, held a
      convention with the Knights of Labor at Cincinnati on May 19, 1891. By
      that time the tide of sentiment in favor of a new party was running
      strong. Some fourteen hundred delegates, a majority of whom were from the
      five States of Ohio, Kansas, Indiana, Illinois, and Nebraska, attended the
      convention and provided for a committee to make arrangements, in
      conjunction with other reform organizations if possible, for a convention
      of the party to nominate candidates for the presidential election of 1892.
      To those who were anxious to have something done immediately the process
      of preparing the ground for a new third party seemed long and laborious.
      Seen in its proper perspective the movement now appears to have been as
      swift as it was inevitable. Once 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
			more, and with greater unanimity than
      ever before, the farmers, especially in the West, threw aside their old
      party allegiance to fight for the things which they deemed not only
      essential to their own welfare but beneficial to the whole country. Some
      aid, it is true, was brought by labor, some by the mining communities of
      the mountain region, some by various reform organizations; but the
      movement as a whole was distinctly and essentially agrarian.

    </h2>
    <p class="chaptertitle">The Populist Bombshell of 1892</p>
		
    <p class="noindent">
      <span class="smcap">The</span> 
			advent of the Populists as a full-fledged party in the domain of
      national politics took place at Omaha in July, 1892. Nearly thirteen
      hundred delegates from all parts of the Union flocked to the convention to
      take part in the selection of candidates for President and Vice-President
      and to adopt a platform for the new party. The "Demands" of the Alliances
      supplied the material from which was constructed a platform characterized
      by one unsympathetic observer as "that furious and hysterical arraignment
      of the present times, that incoherent intermingling of Jeremiah and
      Bellamy." The document opened with a general condemnation of national
      conditions and a bitter denunciation of the old parties for permitting
      "the existing dreadful conditions to develop without serious effort to
      prevent or restrain them." Then followed three declarations: "that the
      union 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
			of the labor forces of the United States this day consummated shall
      be permanent and perpetual"; that "wealth belongs to him who creates it,
      and every dollar taken from industry without an equivalent is robbery";
      and "that the time has come when the railroad corporations will either own
      the people or the people must own the railroads." Next came the demands.
      Heading these were the monetary planks: "a national currency, safe, sound,
      and flexible, issued by the general Government only, a full legal tender
      for all debts," with the sub-treasury system of loans "or a better system;
      free and unlimited coinage of silver and gold at the present legal ratio
      of sixteen to one"; and an increase in the circulating medium until there
      should be not less than $50 per capita. With demands for a graduated
      income tax, for honesty and economy in governmental expenditures, and for
      postal savings banks, the financial part of the platform was complete. The
      usual plank declaring for government ownership and control of railroads
      and telegraphs now included the telephone systems as well, and the land
      plank opposed alien ownership and demanded the return of lands held by
      corporations in excess of their actual needs. Other resolutions, adopted
      but not included in the platform, expressed sympathy 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
			with labor's demands for shorter hours, condemned the use of Pinkerton 
			detectives in labor strife, and favored greater restriction of 
			immigration, the initiative and referendum, direct election of United 
			States senators, and one term for the President and Vice-President.
    </p>
    <p>
      The platform, according to a news dispatch of the time, was "received with
      tremendous enthusiasm &hellip; and was read and adopted almost before the 
			people knew it was read. Instantly there was enacted the mightiest scene 
			ever witnessed by the human race. Fifteen thousand people yelled, 
			shrieked, threw papers, hats, fans, and parasols, gathered up banners, 
			mounted shoulders. Mrs. Lease's little girl was mounted on Dr. Fish's 
			shoulders&mdash;he on a table on the high platform. The two bands were 
			swamped with noise.&hellip; Five minutes passed, ten minutes, twenty, 
			still the noise and hurrahs poured from hoarse throats." After forty 
			minutes the demonstration died out and the convention was ready to 
			proceed with the nomination of a presidential candidate.
    </p>
    <p>
      No such unanimity marked this further procedure, however. Just before the
      convention the leaders of the People's Party had thrown the old parties
      into consternation by announcing that 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
			Judge Walter Q. Gresham, of Indiana, would be offered the nomination. 
			Judge Gresham, a Republican with a long and honorable public record, 
			had been urged upon the Republican party in 1884 and 1888, and 
			"Anti-Monopolists" had considered him with favor on account of his 
			opinions and decisions regarding the operation and control of railroads. 
			Just after the adoption of the platform a telegram from the judge 
			announced that he would accept a unanimous nomination. Since unanimity 
			was unobtainable, however, his name was withdrawn later in the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      This left the field to General James B. Weaver of Iowa and Senator James
      H. Kyle of South Dakota. Weaver represented the more conservative of the
      Populists, the old Alliance men. His rival had the support of the most
      radical element as well as that of the silver men from the mountain
      States. The silverites were not inclined to insist upon their man,
      however, declaring that, if the platform contained the silver plank, they
      would carry their States for whatever candidate might be chosen. The old
      campaigner proved the stronger, and he was nominated with General James G.
      Field of Virginia for Vice-President. Unprejudiced observers viewed
      Weaver's nomination as a tactical error on the part 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
			of the Populist leaders: "Mr. Weaver has belonged to the group of 
			third-party 'come-outers' for so many years that his name is not one to 
			conjure with in either of the old camps; &hellip; his name suggests too 
			strongly the abortive third-party movements of the past to excite much 
			hope or enthusiasm. He is not exactly the sort of a Moses who can frighten 
			Pharaoh into fits or bring convincing plagues upon the monopolistic 
			oppressors of Israel. The wicked politicians of the Republican and 
			Democratic parties breathed easier and ate with better appetites when the 
			Gresham bogie disappeared and they found their familiar old enemy, General 
			Weaver, in the lead of the People's movement."
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be suspected, however, that even with Weaver at its head this
      party, which claimed to control from two to three million votes, and which
      expected to draw heavily from the discontented ranks of the old-line
      organizations, was not viewed with absolute equanimity by the campaign
      managers of Cleveland and of Harrison. Some little evidence of the
      perturbation appeared in the equivocal attitude of both the old parties
      with respect to the silver question. Said the Democratic platform: "We
      hold to the use of both gold and silver 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
			as the standard money of the country, and to the coinage of both gold and 
			silver without discrimination against either metal or charge for mintage." 
			The rival Republican platform declared that "the American people, from 
			tradition and interest, favor bimetallism, and the Republican party 
			demands the use of both gold and silver as standard money." Each party 
			declared for steps to obtain an international agreement on the question. 
			The Republicans attempted to throw a sop to the labor vote by favoring 
			restriction of immigration and laws for the protection of employees in 
			dangerous occupations, and to the farmer by pronouncements against trusts, 
			for extended postal service&mdash;particularly in rural 
			districts&mdash;and for the reclamation and sale of arid lands to
      settlers. The Democrats went even further and demanded the return of
      "nearly one hundred million acres of valuable land" then held by
      "corporations and syndicates, alien and domestic."
    </p>
    <p>
      The directors of the Populist campaign proved to be no mean political
      strategists. General Weaver himself toured the country, accompanied by
      General Field when he was in the South and by Mrs. Lease when he went to
      the Pacific coast. Numerous other men and women addressed the thousands
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
      who attended the meetings, great and small, all over the country. One
      unique feature of the Populist campaign on the Pacific coast was the
      singing of James G. Clark's <i>People's Battle-Hymn</i>, and other songs
      expressing the hope and fears of labor in the field and factory.
      Everywhere it was the policy of the new party to enlist the assistance of
      the weaker of the old parties. In the South, the Populists, as a rule,
      arrayed themselves with the Republicans against the old Democracy. This
      provoked every device of ridicule, class prejudice, and scorn, which the
      dominant party could bring to bear to dissuade former Democrats from
      voting the People's ticket. One Louisiana paper uttered this warning:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      Oily-tongued orators, in many cases the paid agents of the Republican
      party, have for months been circulating among the unsophisticated and more
      credulous classes, preaching their heresies and teaching the people that
      if Weaver is elected president, money may be had for the asking,
      transportation on the railroad trains will be practically free, the
      laboring man will be transferred from his present position and placed upon
      a throne of power, while lakes filled with molasses, whose shores are
      fringed with buckwheat cakes, and islands of Jersey butter rising here and
      there above the surface, will be a concomitant of every farm. The
      'forty-acres-and-a-mule' promises of the reconstruction era pale 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
			into insignificance beside the glowing pictures of prosperity promised by 
			the average Populist orator to those who support Weaver.
    </p>
		</blockquote>
    <p>
      The <i>Pensacola Address</i> of the Populist nominees on September 17, 1892,
      which served as a joint letter of acceptance, was evidently issued at that
      place and time partly for the purpose of influencing such voters as might
      be won over by emphasizing the unquestioned economic distress of most
      Southern farmers. If the new party could substantiate the charges that
      both old parties were the tools of monopoly and Wall Street, it might
      insert the wedge which would eventually split the "solid South." Even
      before the <i>Pensacola Address</i>, the state elections in Alabama and 
			Arkansas demonstrated that co&ouml;peration of Republicans with Populists 
			was not an idle dream. But, although fusion was effected on state tickets 
			in several States in the November elections, the outcome was the choice 
			of Cleveland electors throughout the South.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Populists tried in the South to win over the Republicans, so in the
      North and more especially the West they sought to control the Democratic
      vote either by fusion or absorption. The effort was so successful that in
      Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Nevada, and North Dakota, the new party 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
			swept the field with the assistance of the Democrats. In South Dakota and 
			Nebraska, where there was no fusion, the Democratic vote was negligible 
			and the Populists ran a close second to the Republicans.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the tide of agrarianism was gradually flowing westward as the
      frontier advanced is apparent from the election returns in the States
      bordering on the upper Mississippi. Iowa and Missouri, where the Alliance
      had been strong, experienced none of the landslide which swept out the
      Republicans in States further west. In Minnesota the Populists, with a
      ticket headed by the veteran Donnelly, ran a poor third in the state
      election, and the entire Harrison electoral ticket was victorious in spite
      of the endorsement of four Populist candidates by the Democrats. In the
      northwestern part of the State, however, the new party was strong enough
      to elect a Congressman over candidates of both the old parties. In no
      Northern State east of the Mississippi were the Populists able to make a
      strong showing; but in Illinois, the success of John P. Altgeld, the
      Democratic candidate for governor, was due largely to his advocacy of many
      of the measures demanded by the People's party, particularly those
      relating to labor, and to the support 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
			which he received from the elements which might have been expected to 
			aline themselves with the Populists. On the Pacific coast, despite the 
			musical campaign of Clark, Mrs. Lease, and Weaver, California proved deaf 
			to the People's cause; but in Oregon the party stood second in the lists 
			and in Washington it ran a strong third.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than a million votes, nearly nine per cent of the total, were cast
      for the Populist candidates in this election&mdash;a record for a third
      party the year after its birth, and one exceeded only by that of the
      Republican party when it appeared for the first time in the national arena
      in 1856. Twenty-two electoral votes added point to the showing, for
      hitherto, since 1860, third-party votes had been so scattered that they
      had affected the choice of President only as a makeweight between other
      parties in closely contested States.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week after the elections General Weaver announced that the Populists had
      succeeded far beyond their expectations. "The Republican party," he
      asserted, "is as dead as the Whig party was after the Scott campaign of
      1852, and from this time forward will diminish in every State of the Union
      and cannot make another campaign.&hellip; The Populist will now commence a
      vigorous campaign and 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
			will push the work of organization and education in every county in the 
			Union." There were those, however, who believed that the new party had 
			made a great mistake in having anything to do with either of the old 
			parties, that fusion, particularly of the sort which resulted in 
			combination tickets, was a compromise with the enemy, and that more votes 
			had been lost than won by the process. This feeling found characteristic 
			expression in an editorial in a Minnesota paper:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      Take an audience of republican voters in a schoolhouse where a county
      fusion has taken place&mdash;or the press is full of the electoral 
			deal&mdash;and the audience will applaud the sentiments of the 
			speaker&mdash;but they wont vote a mongrel or democratic ticket! 
			A wet blanket has been thrown!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," says someone, "but the democratic party is a party of reform!" Well,
      my friend, you better go down south and talk that to the peoples party
      where they have been robbed of their franchises by fraud and outrage!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, and there the peoples party fused the republicans!!!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh whitewash! Where is thy lime-kiln, that we may swab off the dark
      blemishes of the hour!! Aye, and on the whited wall, draw thee a picture
      of power and beauty&mdash;Cleveland, for instance, thanking the peoples 
			party for all the favors gratuitously granted by our mongrel saints in 
			speckled linen and green surtouts.
    </p>
		</blockquote>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
      As time gave perspective, however, the opinion grew that 1892 had yielded
      all that could possibly have been hoped. The lessons of the campaign may
      have been hard, but they had been learned, and, withal, a stinging barb
      had been thrust into the side of the Republican party, the organization
      which, in the minds of most crusaders, was principally responsible for the
      creation and nurture of their ills. It was generally determined that in
      the next campaign Populism should stand upon its own feet; Democratic and
      Republican votes should be won by conversion of individuals to the cause
      rather than by hybrid amalgamation of parties and preelection agreements
      for dividing the spoils. But it was just this fusion which blinded the
      eyes of the old party leaders to the significance of the Populist returns.
      Democrats, with a clear majority of electoral votes, were not inclined to
      worry about local losses or to value incidental gains; and Republicans
      felt that the menace of the third party was much less portentous than it
      might have been as an independent movement.

    </h2>
    <p class="chaptertitle">The Silver Issue</p>
		
    <p class="noindent">
      <span class="smcap">A remarkable</span> 
			manifesto, dated February 22, 1895, summarized the grievances
      of the Populists in these words:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      As early as 1865-66 a conspiracy was entered into between the gold
      gamblers of Europe and America to accomplish the following purposes: to
      fasten upon the people of the United States the burdens of perpetual debt;
      to destroy the greenbacks which had safely brought us through the perils
      of war; to strike down silver as a money metal; to deny to the people the
      use of Federal paper and silver&mdash;the two independent sources of money
      guaranteed by the Constitution; to fasten upon the country the single gold
      standard of Britain, and to delegate to thousands of banking corporations,
      organized for private gain, the sovereign control, for all time, over the
      issue and volume of all supplemental paper currency.
    </p>
		</blockquote>
    <p>
      Declaring that the "international gold ring" was summoning all its powers
      to strike at the prosperity of the country, the authors of this address
      called 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
			upon Populists to take up the gauntlet and meet "the enemy upon his
      chosen field of battle," with the "aid and co&ouml;peration of all persons 
			who favor the immediate free coinage of silver at a ratio of 16-1, the 
			issue of all paper money by the Government without the intervention of 
			banks of issue, and who are opposed to the issue of interest-bearing 
			government bonds in the time of peace."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing new in this declaration of hostility to bank issues and
      interest-bearing bonds, nor in this demand for government paper money, for
      these prejudices and this predilection had given rise to the "Ohio idea,"
      by force of which George H. Pendleton had hoped to achieve the presidency
      in 1868. These same notions had been the essence of the platforms of the
      Greenback party in the late seventies; and they had jostled government
      ownership of railroads for first place in pronunciamentos of labor and
      agricultural organizations and of third parties all during the eighties.
      Free silver, on the other hand, although not ignored in the earlier
      period, did not attain foremost rank among the demands of the dissatisfied
      classes until the last decade of the century and more particularly after
      the panic of 1893.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to 1874 or 1875 the "silver question" did 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
			not exist. In 1873
      Congress, moved by the report of a commission it had authorized, had
      demonetized silver; that is, it had provided that the gold dollar should
      be the standard of value, and omitted the standard silver dollar from the
      list of silver coins. &sup1; In this consisted the "Crime of '73." At the time
      when this law was enacted it had not for many years been profitable to
      coin silver bullion into dollars because silver was undervalued at the
      established ratio of sixteen to one. In 1867 the International Monetary
      Conference of Paris had pronounced itself in favor of a single gold
      standard of currency, and the principal countries of Europe had preceded
      the United States in demonetizing silver or in limiting its coinage. In
      1874 as a result of a revision of the statutes of the United States, the
      existing silver dollars were reduced to the basis of subsidiary coins with
      only limited legal tender value.

     of heavier weight, for use in the Orient.

      The Act of 1873 was before Congress for four sessions; every section,
      including that which made gold the sole standard of value, was discussed
      even by those who later claimed that the Act had been passed
      surreptitiously. Whatever opposition 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
			developed at this time was not
      directed against the omission of the silver dollar from the list of coins
      nor against the establishment of a single standard of value. The situation
      was quickly changed, however, by the rapid decline in the market price of
      silver. The bimetallists claimed that this decline was a result of the
      monetary changes; the advocates of the gold standard asserted that it was
      due to the great increase in the production of silver. Whatever the cause,
      the result was that, shortly after silver had been demonetized, its value
      in proportion to gold fell below that expressed by the ratio of sixteen to
      one. Under these circumstances the producers could have made a profit by
      taking their bullion to the mint and having it coined into dollars, if it
      had not been for the Act of 1873. It is not strange, therefore, that the
      people of those Western States whose prosperity depended largely on the
      silver mining industry demanded the remonetization of this metal. At the
      same time the stringency in the money market and the low prices following
      the panic of 1873 added weight to the arguments of those who favored an
      increase in the quantity of currency in circulation and who saw in the
      free and unlimited coinage of silver one means of accomplishing this end.
      So powerful was the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
			demand, especially from the West, that in 1878 the
      Bland-Allison Act, passed over the veto of President Hayes, provided for
      the restoration of the silver dollar to the list of coins, with full legal
      tender quality, and required the Treasury to purchase in the open market
      from two to four million dollars' worth of bullion each month. This
      compromise, however, was unsatisfactory to those who desired the free
      coinage of silver, and it failed to please the champions of the single
      standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      For ten years the question of a choice between a single standard or
      bimetallism, between free coinage or limited coinage of silver, was one of
      the principal economic problems of the world. International conferences,
      destined to have no positive results, met in 1878 and again in 1881; in
      the United States Congress read reports and debated measures on coinage in
      the intervals between tariff debates. Political parties were split on
      sectional lines: Western Republicans and Democrats alike were largely in
      favor of free silver, but their Eastern associates as generally took the
      other side. Party platforms in the different States diverged widely on
      this issue; and monetary planks in national platforms, if included at all,
      were so framed as to commit the party to neither side. Both parties,
      however, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
			could safely pronounce for bimetallism under international
      agreement, since there was little real prospect of procuring such an
      agreement. The minor parties as a rule frankly advocated free silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1890, the subject of silver coinage assumed new importance. The
      silverites in Congress were re&euml;nforced by representatives from new 
			States in the far West, the admission of which had not been unconnected 
			with political exigencies on the part of the Republican party. The 
			advocates of the change were not strong enough to force through a 
			free-silver bill, but they were able by skillful logrolling to bring about 
			the passage of the Silver Purchase Act. This measure, frequently called 
			the Sherman Law, &sup1; directed the Secretary of the Treasury to 
			purchase, with legal tender Treasury notes issued for the purpose, 
			4,500,000 ounces of pure silver each month at the market price. As the 
			metal was worth at that time about a dollar an ounce, this represented an 
			increase, for the time being, over the maximum allowed under the 
			Bland-Allison Act and more than double the minimum required by that 
			measure, which was all the Treasury had ever
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
      purchased. But the Silver Purchase Act failed to check the downward trend
      in the value of the metal. The bullion in a silver dollar, which had been
      worth $1.02 in 1872, had declined to seventy-two cents in 1889. It rose to
      seventy-six in 1891 but then declined rapidly to sixty in 1893, and during
      the next three years the intrinsic value of a "cartwheel" was just about
      half its legal tender value.
    </p>

      <a id="footer_11-2" name="footer_11-2"></a> 
			&sup1; John Sherman, then Secretary of Treasury, had a large
     share in giving final form to the bill, which he favored
     only for fear of a still more objectionable measure. See
     Sherman's <i>Recollections</i>, pp. 1069, 1188.

		</div>
    <p>
      Even under the Bland-Allison Act the Treasury Department had experienced
      great difficulty in keeping in circulation a reasonable proportion of the
      silver dollars and the silver certificates which were issued in lieu of
      part of them, and in maintaining a sufficient gold reserve to insure the
      stability of the currency. When the Silver Purchase Act went into
      operation, therefore, the monetary situation contributed its share to
      conditions which produced the panic of 1893. Thereupon the silver issue
      became more than ever a matter of nation-wide discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the Atlantic to the Pacific the country was flooded with
      controversial writing, much of it cast in a form to make an appeal to
      classes which had neither the leisure nor the training to master this very
      intricate economic problem. W.&nbsp;H. Harvey's <i>Coin's Financial 
			School</i> was the most widely read 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
			campaign document, although hundreds of similar pamphlets
      and books had an enormous circulation. The pithy and plausible arguments
      of "Coin" and his ready answers to questions supposedly put by prominent
      editors, bankers, and university professors, as well as by J.&nbsp;R.
      Sovereign, master workman of the Knights of Labor, tickled the fancy of
      thousands of farmers who saw their own plight depicted in the crude but
      telling woodcuts which sprinkled the pages of the book. In his mythical
      school "the smooth little financier" converted to silver many who had been
      arguing for gold; but&mdash;what is more to the point&mdash;he also
      convinced hundreds of voters that gold was the weapon with which the
      bankers of England and America had slain silver in order to maintain high
      interest rates while reducing prices, and that it was the tool with which
      they were everywhere welding the shackles upon labor. "Coin" harped upon a
      string to which, down to the time of the Spanish War, most Americans were
      ever responsive&mdash;the conflict of interests between England and the
      United States. "If it is claimed," he said, "we must adopt for our money
      the metal England selects, and can have no independent choice in the
      matter, let us make the test and find out if it is true." He pointed to
      the nations of the earth where 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
			a silver standard ruled: "The farmer in Mexico sells his bushel of wheat 
			for one dollar. The farmer in the United States sells his bushel of wheat 
			for fifty cents. The former is proven by the history of the world to be an 
			equitable price. The latter is writing its history, in letters of blood, 
			on the appalling cloud of debt that is sweeping with ruin and desolation 
			over the farmers of this country."
    </p>
    <p>
      When many men of sound reputation believed the maintenance of a gold
      standard impossible what wonder that millions of farmers shouted with
      "Coin": "Give the people back their favored primary money! Give us two
      arms with which to transact business! Silver the right arm and gold the
      left arm! Silver the money of the people, and gold the money of the rich.
      Stop this legalized robbery that is transferring the property of the
      debtors to the possession of the creditors.&hellip; Drive these 
			money-changers from our temples. Let them discover your aspect, their 
			masters&mdash;the people."
    </p>
    <p>
      The relations of the Populist party to silver were at once the result of
      conviction and expediency; cheap money had been one, frequently the most
      prominent, of the demands of the farming class, not only from the
      inception of the Greenback 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
			movement, as we have seen, but from the very beginning of American 
			history. Indeed, the pioneer everywhere has needed capital and has 
			believed that it could be obtained only through money. The cheaper the 
			money, the better it served his needs. The Western farmer preferred, 
			other things being equal, that the supply of currency should be 
			increased by direct issue of paper by the Government. Things, however,
      were not equal. In the Mountain States were many interested in silver as a
      commodity whose assistance could be counted on in a campaign to increase
      the amount of the metal in circulation. There were, moreover, many other
      voters who, while regarding Greenbackism as an economic heresy, were
      convinced that bimetallism offered a safe and sound solution of the
      currency problem. For the sake of added votes the inflationists were ready
      to waive any preference as to the form in which the cheap money should be
      issued. Before the actual formation of the People's Party, the farmers'
      organizations had set out to capture votes by advocating free silver.
      After the election of 1892 free silver captured the Populist organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heartened by the large vote of 1892 the Populist leaders prepared to drive
      the wedge further into the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
			old parties and even hoped to send their candidates through the breach to 
			Congress and the presidency. A secret organization, known as the 
			Industrial League of the United States, in which the leaders were for the 
			most part the prominent officials of the People's Party, afforded for a 
			time through its lodges the machinery with which to control and organize 
			the silverites of the West and the South.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most notable triumph of 1893 was the selection of Judge William V.
      Allen, by the Democrats and Independents of Nebraska, to represent that
      State in the United States Senate. Born in Ohio, in a house which had been
      a station on the "underground railroad" to assist escaping negroes, Allen
      at ten years of age had gone with his family to Iowa. After one
      unsuccessful attempt, he enlisted in the Union Army at the age of fifteen
      and served from 1862 to the end of the War. When peace came, he resumed
      his schooling, attended college, studied law, and in 1869 was admitted to
      the bar. In 1884 he went to Madison County, Nebraska, where seven years
      later he was elected district judge by the Populists. Reared in a family
      which had been Republican, he himself had supported this party until the
      campaign of 1890. "I have always," said he, "looked upon a political party
			&hellip;
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
      simply as a means to an end. I think a party should be held no more sacred
      than a man's shoes or garments, and that whenever it fails to subserve the
      purposes of good government a man should abandon it as cheerfully as he
      dispenses with his wornout clothes." As Senator, Allen attracted attention
      not only by his powers of physical endurance as attested by a fifteen-hour
      speech in opposition to the bill for the repeal of the Silver Purchase
      Act, but also by his integrity of character. "If Populism can produce men
      of Senator Allen's mold," was the comment of one Eastern review, "and then
      lift them into positions of the highest responsibility, one might be
      tempted to suggest that an epidemic of this Western malady would prove
      beneficial to some Eastern communities and have salutary results for the
      nation at large."
    </p>
    <p>
      In this same year (1893) Kansas became a storm-center in national politics
      once more by reason of a contest between parties for control of the lower
      house of the legislature. The returns had given the Republicans a majority
      in the assembly, but several Republican seats had been contested on
      suspicion of fraud. If the holders of these seats were debarred from
      voting, the Populists could outvote the Republicans. The situation itself
      was fraught 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
			with comedy; and the actions of the contestants made it
      nothing less than farce. The assembly convened on the 10th of January, and
      both Republican and Populist speakers were declared duly elected by their
      respective factions. Loftily ignoring each other, the two speakers went to
      the desk and attempted to conduct the business of the house. Neither party
      left the assembly chamber that night; the members slept on the benches;
      the speakers called a truce at two in the morning, and lay down, gavels in
      hand, facing each other behind the desk, to get what rest they could. For
      over two weeks the two houses continued in tumultuous session. Meanwhile
      men were crowding into Topeka from all over the State: grim-faced Populist
      farmers, determined that Republican chicanery should not wrest from them
      the fruits of the election; equally determined Republicans, resolved that
      the Populists should not, by charges of election fraud, rob them of their
      hard-won majority. Both sides came armed but apparently hoping to avoid
      bloodshed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, on the 15th of February, the Populist house retreated from the
      chamber, leaving the Republicans in possession, and proceeded to transact
      business of state in the corridor of the Capitol. 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
			Populist sympathizers now besieged the assembly chamber, immuring the 
			luckless Republicans and incidentally a few women who had come in as 
			members of the suffrage lobby and were now getting more of political 
			equality than they had anticipated. Food had to be sent through the 
			Populist lines in baskets, or drawn up to the windows of the chamber 
			while the Populist mob sat on the main stairway within. Towards evening, 
			the Populist janitor turned off the heat; and the Republicans shivered 
			until oil stoves were fetched by their followers outside and hoisted 
			through the windows. The Republican sheriff swore in men of his party as 
			special deputies; the Populist governor called out the militia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation was at once too absurd and too grave to be permitted to
      continue. "Sockless" Jerry Simpson now counseled the Populists to let the
      decision go to the courts. The judges, to be sure, were Republican; but
      Simpson, ever resourceful, argued that if they decided against the
      Populists, the house and senate could then impeach them. Mrs. Lease,
      however, was sure that the Populists would not have the courage to take up
      impeachment proceedings, and the event proved her judgment correct. When
      the struggle was 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
			finally brought to an end with the assistance of the
      judicial machinery, the Republicans were left in control of the house of
      representatives, while the Populists retained the senate. In joint session
      the Republicans could be outvoted; hence a silver Democrat, John Martin,
      was sent to Washington to work with Peffer in the Senate for the common
      cause of silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      The congressional and state elections of 1894 revealed the unstable
      equilibrium of parties, and at the same time the total Populist vote of
      nearly a million and a half reflected the increasing popular unrest. In
      the West, however, the new party was not so successful in winning
      elections as it had been in 1892 because the hostile attitude, sometimes
      of the Populists and sometimes of the Democrats, made fusion impossible in
      most cases. A few victories were won, to be sure: Nebraska elected a
      free-silver Democrat-Populist governor, while Nevada was carried by the
      silver party; but Colorado, Idaho, Wyoming, Kansas, and North Dakota
      returned to the Republican fold. In the South, the fusion between
      Populists and Republicans against the dominant Democrats was more
      successful. From several States, Congressmen were elected, who, whether
      under the name of Populist or 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
			Republican, represented the radical element.
      In South Carolina the Democratic party adopted the Farmers' Alliance
      platform, swept the State in the elections, and sent "Pitchfork" Tillman
      to the United States Senate as an anti-administration Democrat. Tillman
      admitted that he was not one of those infatuated persons who believed that
      "all the financial wisdom in the country is monopolized by the East," and
      who said, "'Me, too,' every time Cleveland grunts." "Send me to
      Washington," was his advice to cheering crowds, "and I'll stick my
      pitchfork into his old ribs!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Every political move in 1895 was calculated with reference to the
      presidential election of 1896. Both old parties were inoculated with the
      free-silver virus; silver men could have passed a free coinage bill in
      both houses of Congress at any moment but were restrained chiefly by the
      knowledge that such a measure would be vetoed by President Cleveland. The
      free coinage of silver, which was the chief demand of Populism, was also
      the ardent desire of a majority of the people west of the Alleghanies,
      irrespective of their political affiliations. Nothing seemed more logical,
      then, than the union of all silver men to enforce the adoption of their
      program. There was great diversity of opinion, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
			however, as to the best means of accomplishing this union. General Weaver 
			started a movement to add the forces of the American Bimetallic League and 
			the silver Democrats to the ranks of the People's Party. But the silver 
			Democrats, believing that they comprised a majority of the party, 
			proceeded to organize themselves for the purpose of controlling that party 
			at its coming national conventions; and most of the Populist leaders felt 
			that, should this movement be victorious, the greatest prospect of success 
			for their program lay in a fusion of the two parties. Some there were, 
			indeed, who opposed fusion under any conditions, foreseeing that it would 
			mean the eventual extinction of the People's Party. Prominent among these 
			were Ignatius Donnelly of Minnesota, "General" J.&nbsp;S. Coxey of Ohio, 
			and Senator Peffer of Kansas. In the South the "middle-of-the-road" 
			element, as the opponents of fusion were called, was especially strong, 
			for there the Populists had been co&ouml;perating with the Republicans 
			since 1892, and not even agreement on the silver issue could break down 
			the barrier of antagonism between them and the old-line Democrats.
    </p>
    <p>
      It remained, then, for the political events of 1896 to decide which way
      the current of Populism would 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
			flow&mdash;whether it would maintain an independent course, receiving 
			tributaries from every political source, eventually becoming a mighty 
			river, and, like the Republican party of 1856 and 1860, sweeping away 
			an older party; or whether it would turn aside and mingle with the 
			stream of Democracy, there to lose its identity forever.

    <p class="noindent">
      <span class="smcap">When</span> 
			the Republicans met in convention at St. Louis in the middle of June,
      1896, the monetary issue had already dwarfed all other political
      questions. It was indeed the rock on which the party might have crashed in
      utter shipwreck but for the precautions of one man who had charted the
      angry waters and the dangerous shoals and who now had a firm grasp on the
      helm. Marcus A. Hanna, or "Uncle Mark," was the genial owner of more
      mines, oil wells, street railways, aldermen, and legislators than any
      other man in Ohio. Hanna was an almost perfect example of what the
      Populists denounced as the capitalist in politics. Cynically declaring
      that "no man in public life owes the public anything," he had gone his
      unscrupulous way, getting control of the political machine of Cleveland,
      acquiring influence in the state legislature, and now even assuming
      dictatorship over the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
			national Republican party. Because he had found that political power was 
			helpful in the prosecution of his vast business enterprises, he went forth 
			to accumulate political power, just as frankly as he would have gone to 
			buy the machinery for pumping oil from one of his wells. Hanna was a 
			stanch friend of the gold standard, but he was too clever to alienate the 
			sympathies of the Republican silverites by supporting the nomination of a 
			man known to be an uncompromising advocate of gold. He chose a safer 
			candidate, a man whose character he sincerely admired and whose opinions 
			he might reasonably expect to sway&mdash;his personal friend, Major 
			William McKinley. This was a clever choice: McKinley was known to the 
			public largely as the author of the McKinley tariff bill; his 
			protectionism pleased the East; and what was known of his attitude on the 
			currency question did not offend the West. In Congress he had voted for 
			the Bland-Allison bill and had advocated the freer use of silver. 
			McKinley was, indeed, an ideally "safe" candidate, an upright,
      affable gentleman whose aquiline features conferred on him the semblance
      of commanding power and masked the essential weakness and indecision which
      would make him, from Mark Hanna's point of view, a desirable 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
			President. McKinley would always swim with the tide.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his friend's behalf Hanna carried on a shrewd campaign in the
      newspapers, keeping the question of currency in the background as far as
      possible, playing up McKinley's sound tariff policy, and repeating often
      the slogan&mdash;welcome after the recent lean years&mdash;"McKinley and
      the full dinner pail." McKinley prudently refused to take any stand on the
      currency question, protesting that he could not anticipate the party
      platform and that he would be bound by whatever declarations the party
      might see fit to make. Even after the convention had opened, McKinley and
      Hanna were reticent on the silver question. Finally, fearing that some
      kind of compromise would be made, the advocates of the gold standard went
      to Mr. Hanna and demanded that a gold plank be incorporated in the
      platform. Hanna gracefully acceded to their demands and thus put them
      under obligation to repay him by supporting McKinley for the nomination.
      The platform which was forthwith reported to the convention contained the
      unequivocal gold plank, as Hanna had long before planned. Immediately
      thereafter a minority of thirty-four delegates, led by Senator Teller of
      Colorado, left the convention, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
			later to send out an address advising all
      Republicans who believed in free coinage of silver to support the
      Democratic ticket. The nomination of William McKinley and Garret A. Hobart
      followed with very little opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing cut and dried about the Democratic convention which
      assembled three weeks later in Chicago. The Northeastern States and a few
      others sent delegations in favor of the gold standard, but free silver and
      the West were in the saddle. This was demonstrated when, in the face of
      all precedent, the nominee of the national committee for temporary
      chairman was rejected in favor of Senator John W. Daniel of Virginia, a
      strong silver man. The second day of the convention saw the advantage
      pushed further: each Territory had its representation increased threefold;
      of contesting delegations those who represented the gold element in their
      respective States were unseated to make way for silverites; and Stephen M.
      White, one of the California senators, was made permanent chairman.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third day of the convention the platform, devoted largely to the
      money question, was the subject of bitter debate. "We are unalterably
      opposed to monometallism, which has locked fast 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
			the prosperity of an
      industrial people in the paralysis of hard times," proclaimed the report
      of the committee on resolutions. "Gold monometallism is a British policy,
      and its adoption has brought other nations into financial servitude to
      London.&hellip; We demand the free and unlimited coinage of both gold and
      silver at the present legal ratio of sixteen to one without waiting for
      the aid or consent of any other nation." A minority of the committee on
      resolutions proposed two amendments to the report, one pronouncing in
      favor of a gold standard, and the other commending the record of Grover
      Cleveland, a courtesy always extended to a presidential incumbent of the
      same party. At the name of Cleveland, Senator Tillman leaped to his feet
      and delivered himself of characteristic invective against the President,
      the "tool of Wall Street," the abject slave of gold. Senator David B. Hill
      of New York, who had been rejected for temporary chairman, defended the
      gold plank in a logical analysis of monetary principles. But logical
      analysis could not prevail against emotion; that clamorous mass of men was
      past reasoning now, borne they hardly knew whither on the current of their
      own excitement. He might as well have tried to dam Niagara.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
      Others tried to stem the onrushing tide but with no better success. It
      seemed to be impossible for any one to command the attention and respect
      of that tumultuous gathering. Even Senator James K. Jones of Arkansas, a
      member of the majority group of the committee on resolutions, failed
      equally with Tillman to give satisfactory expression to the sentiments of
      that convention, which felt inchoately what it desired but which still
      needed a leader to voice its aspirations. This spokesman the convention
      now found in William Jennings Bryan, to whom after a few sentences Senator
      Jones yielded the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryan appeared in Chicago as a member of the contesting silver delegation
      from Nebraska. A young man, barely thirty-six years old, he had already
      become a well-known figure in the West, where for years he had been
      expounding the doctrine of free silver. A native of Illinois, whither his
      father had come from Culpeper County, Virginia, Bryan had grown up on a
      farm. His father's means had been ample to afford him a good education,
      which he completed, so far as schooling was concerned, at Illinois
      College, Jacksonville, and at the Union College of Law in Chicago. While
      in Chicago Bryan was employed in the law office of 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
			Lyman Trumbull, one of
      the stanchest representatives of independence in politics&mdash;an
      independence which had caused him to break with the Democratic party over
      the slavery issue, and which, as expressed in his vote against the
      impeachment of President Johnson, had resulted in his retirement to
      private life. To the young law student Trumbull took a particular fancy,
      and his dominating personality exerted an abiding influence over the
      character and career of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a brief period of law practice in Jacksonville, Illinois, Bryan
      removed with his family to Lincoln, Nebraska. The legal profession never
      held great attraction for him, despite the encouragement and assistance of
      his wife, who herself took up the study of law after her marriage and was
      admitted to the bar. Public questions and politics held greater interest
      for the young man, who had already, in his college career, shown his
      ability as an orator. Nebraska offered the opportunity he craved. At the
      Democratic state convention in Omaha in 1888 he made a speech on the
      tariff which gave him immediately a state-wide reputation as an orator and
      expounder of public issues. He took an active part in the campaign of that
      year, and in 1889 was offered, but declined, the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
			nomination for lieutenant governor on the Democratic ticket. In 1890 he 
			won election to Congress by a majority of seven thousand in a district 
			which two years before had returned a Republican, and this he accomplished 
			in spite of the neglect of party managers who regarded the district as 
			hopeless. In Congress he became a member of the Committee on Ways and 
			Means. On the floor of the House his formal speeches on the tariff, a 
			topic to which nothing new could be brought, commanded the attention of 
			one of the most critical and blas&eacute; audiences of the world. The 
			silver question, which was the principal topic before Congress at the 
			following session, afforded a fresher field for his oratory; indeed, 
			Bryan was the principal aid to Bland both as speaker and parliamentarian 
			in the old leader's monetary campaign. When Bryan sat down after a 
			three-hour speech in which he attacked the gold standard, a colleague 
			remarked, "It exhausts the subject." In 1894 a tidal wave of 
			Republicanism destroyed Bryan's chances of being elected United
      States Senator, a consummation for which he had been laboring on the stump
      and, for a brief period, as editor of the Omaha <i>World-Herald</i>. He
      continued, however, to urge the silver cause in preparation for the
      presidential campaign of 1896.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
      Taller and broader than most men and of more commanding presence, Bryan
      was a striking figure in the convention hall. He wore the inevitable black
      suit of the professional man of the nineties, but his dress did not seem
      conventional: his black tie sat at too careless an angle; his black hair
      was a little too long. These eccentricities the cartoonists seized on and
      exaggerated so that most people who have not seen the man picture Bryan,
      not as a determined looking man with a piercing eye and tightset mouth,
      but as a grotesque frock-coated figure with the sombrero of a cow-puncher
      and the hair of a poet. If the delegates at the convention noticed any of
      these peculiarities as Bryan arose to speak, they soon forgot them. His
      undoubted power to carry an audience with him was never better
      demonstrated than on that sweltering July day in Chicago when he stilled
      the tumult of a seething mass of 15,000 people with his announcement that
      he came to speak "in defense of a cause as holy as the cause of liberty&mdash;the
      cause of humanity," and when he stirred the same audience to frenzy with
      his closing defiance of the opponents of free silver:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
		<p class="noindent">  
      If they say bimetallism is good, but that we cannot have it until other
      nations help us, we reply that, instead of having a gold standard because
      England has, we will 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
			restore bimetallism, and then let England have
      bimetallism because the United States has it. If they dare to come out in
      the open field and defend the gold standard as a good thing, we will fight
      them to the uttermost. Having behind us the producing masses of this
      nation and the world, supported by the commercial interests, the laboring
      interests, and the toilers everywhere, we will answer their demand for a
      gold standard by saying to them: You shall not press down upon the brow of
      labor this crown of thorns, you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of
      gold.
    </p>
		</blockquote>
    <p>
      Meeting Senator Hill's careful arguments with a clever retort, blunting
      the keenness of his logic with a well-turned period, polished to
      perfection by numerous repetitions before all sorts of audiences during
      the previous three or four years, Bryan held the convention in the hollow
      of his hand. The leadership which had hitherto been lacking was now found.
      The platform as reported by the committee was adopted by a vote of more
      than two to one; and the convention, but for the opposition of Bryan
      himself, would have nominated him on the spot. The next day it took but
      five ballots to set aside all the favorite sons, including the "Father of
      Free Silver" himself, Richard P. Bland, and to make Bryan the standard
      bearer of the party.

	<p>
			Far different in character and appearance from 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
			the
      Republican group which had assembled in the same building a few weeks
      before, was the Populist convention which met in St. Louis late in July.
      Many of the 1300 delegates were white-haired and had grown old in the
      service of reform in the various independent movements of preceding years;
      some of them had walked long distances to save railroad fare, while others
      were so poor that, having exhausted their small store of money before the
      long-drawn-out convention adjourned, they suffered from want of regular
      sleeping places and adequate food. All were impressed with the
      significance of the decision they must make.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gone were the hopes of the past months; the Populist party would not sweep
      into its ranks all anti-monopolists and all silverites&mdash;for one of
      the old parties had stolen its loudest thunder! It was an error of
      political strategy to place the convention after those of the two great
      parties in the expectation that both would stand on a gold platform. Now
      it was for these delegates to decide whether they would put their
      organization behind the Democratic nominee with a substantial prospect of
      victory, or preserve intact the identity of the Populist party, split the
      silver vote, and deliver over the election to a gold Republican.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
      The majority of the delegates, believing that the Democratic party had
      been inoculated with the serum of reform, were ready for the sake of a
      principle to risk the destruction of the party they had labored so hard to
      build. Senator William V. Allen of Nebraska summed up the situation when
      he said:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      If by putting a third ticket in the field you would defeat free coinage;
      defeat a withdrawal of the issue power of national banks; defeat
      Government ownership of railroads, telephones and telegraphs; defeat an
      income tax and foist gold monometallism and high taxation upon the people
      for a generation to come, which would you do? &hellip; When I shall go back to
      the splendid commonwealth that has so signally honored me beyond my
      merits, I want to be able to say to the people that all the great
      doctrines we have advocated for years, have been made possible by your
      action. I do not want them to say that the Populists have been advocates
      of reforms when they could not be accomplished, but when the first ray of
      light appeared and the people were looking with expectancy and with
      anxiety for relief, the party was not equal to the occasion; that it was
      stupid; it was blind; it kept "the middle of the road," and missed the
      golden opportunity.
    </p>
		</blockquote>
    <p>
      Although most of the members of the convention were ready to co&ouml;perate
      with the Democrats, there was a very strong feeling that something should
      be done, if possible, to preserve the identity of the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
			Populist party and
      to safeguard its future. An active minority, moreover, was opposed to any
      sort of fusion or co&ouml;peration. This "middle-of-the-road" group included
      some Western leaders of prominence, such as Peffer and Donnelly, but its
      main support came from the Southern delegates. To them an alliance with
      the Democratic party meant a surrender to the enemy, to an enemy with whom
      they had been struggling for four years for the control of their state and
      local governments. Passionately they pleaded with the convention to save
      them from such a calamity. Well they knew that small consideration would
      be given to those who had dared stand up and oppose the ruling aristocracy
      of the South, who had even shaken the Democratic grip upon the governments
      of some of the States. Further, a negro delegate from Georgia portrayed
      the disaster which would overwhelm the political aspirations of his people
      if the Populist party, which alone had given them full fellowship, should
      surrender to the Democrats.
    </p>
    <p>
      The advocates of fusion won their first victory in the election of Senator
      Allen as permanent chairman, by a vote of 758 to 564. As the nomination of
      Bryan for President was practically a foregone conclusion, the
      "middle-of-the-road" element 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
			concentrated its energies on preventing the nomination of Arthur Sewall 
			of Maine, the choice of the Democracy, for Vice-President. The convention 
			was persuaded, by a narrow margin, to take the unusual step of selecting 
			the candidate for Vice-President before the head of the ticket was chosen. 
			On the first ballot Sewall received only 257 votes, while 469 were cast 
			for Thomas Watson of Georgia. Watson, who was then nominated by 
			acclamation, was a country editor who had made himself a force in the 
			politics of his own State and had served the Populist cause conspicuously 
			in Congress. Two motives influenced the convention in this procedure. As 
			a bank president, a railroad director, and an employer of labor on a 
			large scale, Sewall was felt to be utterly unsuited to carry the standard 
			of the People's Party. More effective than this feeling, however, was the 
			desire to do something to preserve the identity of the party, to show that 
			it had not wholly surrendered to the Democrats. It was a compromise, 
			moreover, which was probably necessary to prevent a bolt of the 
			"middle-of-the-road" element and the nomination of an entirely 
			independent ticket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even with this concession the Southern delegates continued their
      opposition to fusion. Bryan was 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
			placed in nomination, quite appropriately,
      by General Weaver, who again expressed the sense of the convention: "After
      due consideration, in which I have fully canvassed every possible phase of
      the subject, I have failed to find a single good reason to justify us in
      placing a third ticket in the field.&hellip; I would not endorse the
      distinguished gentleman named at Chicago. I would nominate him outright,
      and make him our own, and then share justly and rightfully in his
      election." The irreconcilables, nearly all from the South and including a
      hundred delegates from Texas, voted for S.&nbsp;F. Norton of Chicago, who
      received 321 votes as against 1042 for Bryan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of the electoral system, the agreement of two parties to support
      the same candidate for President could have no effect, unless arrangements
      were made for fusion within the States. An address issued by the executive
      committee of the national committee of the People's Party during the
      course of the campaign outlined the method of uniting "the voters of the
      country against McKinley," and of overcoming the "obstacles and
      embarrassments which, if the Democratic party had put the cause first and
      party second," would not have been encountered: "This could be
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
      accomplished only by arranging for a division of the electoral votes in
      every State possible, securing so many electors for Bryan and Watson and
      conceding so many to Bryan and Sewall. At the opening of the campaign
      this, under the circumstances, seemed the wisest course for your
      committee, and it is clearer today than ever that it was the only safe and
      wise course if your votes were to be cast and made effective for the
      relief of an oppressed and outraged people. Following this line of policy
      your committee has arranged electoral tickets in three-fourths of the
      States and will do all in its power to make the same arrangements in all
      of the States."
    </p>
    <p>
      The committee felt it necessary to warn the people of the danger of "a
      certain portion of the rank and file of the People's Party being misled by
      so-called leaders, who, for reasons best known to themselves, or for want
      of reason, are advising voters to rebel against the joint electoral
      tickets and put up separate electoral tickets, or to withhold their
      support from the joint electoral tickets." Such so-called leaders were
      said to be aided and abetted by "Democrats of the revenue stripe, who are
      not yet weaned from the flesh-pots of Egypt," and by Republican "goldbugs"
      who in desperation 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
			were seizing upon every straw to prevent fusion and so
      to promote their own chances of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the North and West, where the Populist had been fusing with the
      Democrats off and on for several years, the combinations were arranged
      with little difficulty. In apportioning the places on the electoral
      tickets the strength of the respective parties was roughly represented by
      the number of places assigned to each. Usually it was understood that all
      the electors, if victorious, would vote for Bryan, while the Democrats
      would cast their second place ballots for Sewall and the Populists for
      Watson.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the South much more difficulty was experienced in arranging fusion
      tickets, and the spectacle of Populists co&ouml;perating with Republicans in
      state elections and with Democrats in the national election illustrated
      the truth of the adage that "politics makes strange bedfellows." Only in
      Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, and North Carolina, of the
      Southern States, were joint electoral tickets finally agreed upon. In
      Tennessee the Populists offered to support the Democratic electors if they
      would all promise to vote for Watson, a proposal which was naturally
      declined. In Florida the chairman of the state committee of the People's
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
      Party, went so far on the eve of the election as to advise all members of
      the party to vote for McKinley; and in Texas there was an organized bolt
      of a large part of the Populists to the Republican party, notwithstanding
      its gold standard and protective tariff platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      No campaign since that of 1860 was so hotly and bitterly contested as the
      "Battle of the Standards" in 1896. The Republicans broke all previous
      records in the amount of printed matter which they scattered broadcast
      over the country. Money was freely spent. McKinley remained at his home in
      Canton, Ohio, and received, day after day, delegations of pilgrims come to
      harken to his words of wisdom, which were then, through the medium of the
      press, presented to similar groups from Maine to California. For weeks,
      ten to twenty-five thousand people a day sought "the shrine of the golden
      calf."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Bryan, as the Democrat-Populist candidate, toured the
      country, traveling over thirteen thousand miles, reaching twenty-nine
      States, and addressing millions of voters. It was estimated, for instance,
      that in the course of his tour of West Virginia at least half the
      electorate must have heard his voice. Most of the influential 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
			newspapers were opposed to Bryan, but his tours and meetings and speeches 
			had so much news value that they received the widest publicity. As the 
			campaign drew to a close, it tended more and more to become a class 
			contest. That it was so conceived by the Populist executive committee is 
			apparent from one of its manifestoes:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      There are but two sides in the conflict that is being waged in this
      country today. On the one side are the allied hosts of monopolies, the
      money power, great trusts and railroad corporations, who seek the
      enactment of laws to benefit them and impoverish the people. On the other
      side are the farmers, laborers, merchants, and all others who produce
      wealth and bear the burdens of taxation. The one represents the wealthy
      and powerful classes who want the control of the Government to plunder the
      people. The other represents the people, contending for equality before
      the law, and the rights of man. Between these two there is no middle
      ground.
    </p>
		</blockquote>
    <p>
      When the smoke of battle cleared away the election returns of 1896 showed
      that McKinley had received 600,000 more popular votes than Bryan and would
      have 271 electoral votes to 176 for the Democrat-Populist candidate. West
      of the Mississippi River the cohorts of Bryan captured the electoral vote
      in every State except California, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
			Minnesota, North Dakota, Iowa, and Oregon. The South continued its 
			Democratic solidity, except that West Virginia and Kentucky went to 
			McKinley. All the electoral votes of the region east of the Mississippi 
			and north of Mason's and Dixon's line were Republican. The old Northwest, 
			together with Iowa, Minnesota, and North Dakota, a region which had been 
			the principal theater of the Granger movement a generation before, now 
			joined forces with the conservative and industrial East to defeat a 
			combination of the South with the newer agrarian and mining frontiers of 
			the West.
    </p>
    <p>
      The People's Party had staked all on a throw of the dice and had lost. It
      had given its life as a political organization to further the election of
      Bryan, and he had not been elected. Its hope for independent existence was
      now gone; its strength was considerably less in 1896 than it had been in
      1892 and 1894. &sup1; The explanation would seem to 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
			be, in part at least, that
      the People's Party was "bivertebrate as well as bimetallic." It was
      composed of men who not long since had other political affiliations, who
      had left one party for the sake of the cause, and who consequently did not
      find it difficult to leave another for the same reason. In 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
			the West large numbers of former Populists undoubtedly went over 
			completely to the Democracy, even when they had the opportunity of voting 
			for the same Bryan electors under a Populist label. In the South many 
			members of the party, disgusted at the predicament in which they found 
			themselves, threw in their lot with the Republicans. The capture of the 
			Democracy by the forces of free silver gave the death blow to Populism.
    </p>
		<div class="footer">
		  <p>
      <a id="footer_12-1" name="footer_12-1"></a> 
			&sup1; Of the 6,509,000 votes which Bryan received, about
     4,669,000 were cast for the fusion electoral tickets. In
     only seven of the fusion States is it possible to
     distinguish between Democrat and Populist votes; the totals
     here are 1,499,000 and 93,000 respectively. The fusion
     Populist vote of 45,000 was essential for the success of the
     Bryan electors in Kansas; and in California the similar vote
     of 22,000, added to that of the Democrats, gave Bryan one of
     the electors. In no other State in this group did the
     Populist vote have any effect upon the result. The part
     played by the People's party in the other twenty-two of the
     fusion States is difficult to determine; in some cases,
     however, the situation is revealed in the results of state
     elections. The best example of this is North Carolina, where
     the Democrat-Populist electors had a majority of 19,000,
     while at the same election Fusion between Republicans and
     Populists for all state officers except governor and
     lieutenant governor was victorious. The Populist candidate
     for governor received about 31,000 votes and the Republican
     was elected. It is evident that the third party held the
     balance of power in North Carolina. The Populist votes were
     probably essential for the fusion victories in Idaho,
     Montana, Nebraska, and Washington; but, as there was fusion
     on state tickets also, it is impossible to estimate the part
     played by the respective parties. The total Populist vote in
     the ten States in which there were independent Democratic
     and Populist electoral tickets was 122,000 (of which 80,000
     were cast in Texas and 24,000 in Alabama) and as none of the
     ten were close States the failure to agree on electoral
     tickets had no effect on the result. The "middle-of-the-road" 
		 Populist votes, in States where there were also fusion
     tickets amounted to only 8000&mdash;of which 6000 were cast in
     Pennsylvania and 1000 each in Illinois and Kansas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Populist vote as a whole was much larger than 223,000&mdash;the total
      usually given in the tables&mdash;for this figure does not include the
      vote in the twenty-two fusion States in which the ballots were not
      separately counted. This is apparent from the fact that the twenty-seven
      electoral votes from ten States which were cast for Watson came, with one
      exception, from States in which no separate Populist vote was recorded. It
      is evident, nevertheless, from the figures in States where comparisons are
      possible, that the party had lost ground.

    </h2>
    <p class="chaptertitle">The Leaven of Radicalism</p>
		
    <p class="noindent">
      <span class="smcap">The</span> 
			People's Party was mortally stricken by the events of 1896. Most of
      the cohorts which had been led into the camp of Democracy were thereafter
      beyond the control of their leaders; and even the remnant that still
      called itself Populist was divided into two factions. In 1900 the radical
      group refused to endorse the Fusionists' nomination of Bryan and ran an
      independent ticket headed by Wharton Barker of Pennsylvania and that
      inveterate rebel, Ignatius Donnelly. This ticket, however, received only
      50,000 votes, nearly one-half of which came from Texas. When the Democrats
      nominated Judge Alton B. Parker of New York in 1904, the Populists
      formally dissolved the alliance with the Democracy and nominated Thomas E.
      Watson of Georgia for President. By this defection the Democrats may have
      lost something; but the Populists gained little. Most of the radicals 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
			who
      deserted the Democracy at this time went over to Roosevelt, the Republican
      candidate. In 1908 the Populist vote fell to 29,000; in 1912 the party
      gave up the ghost in a thinly-attended convention which neither made
      nominations of its own nor endorsed any other candidate. In Congress the
      forces of Populism dwindled rapidly, from the 27 members of 1897 to but 10
      in 1899, and none at all in 1903.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men who had been leaders in the heyday of Populism retired from
      national prominence to mere local celebrity. Donnelly died in 1901,
      leaving a picturesque legacy of friendships and animosities, of literary
      controversy and radical political theory. Weaver remained with the fusion
      Populists through the campaign of 1900; but by 1904 he had gone over to
      the Democratic party. The erstwhile candidate for the presidency was
      content to serve as mayor of the small town of Colfax, Iowa, where he made
      his home until his death in 1912, respected by his neighbors and forgotten
      by the world. Peffer, at the expiration of his term in the Senate, ran an
      unsuccessful tilt for the governorship of Kansas on the Prohibition
      ticket. In 1900 he returned to the comfort of the Republican fold, to
      become an ardent supporter of McKinley and Roosevelt.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
      But the defection and death of Populist leaders, the collapse of the
      party, and the disintegration of the alliances could not stay the farmers'
      movement. It ebbed for a time, just as at the end of the Granger period,
      but it was destined to rise again. The unprecedented prosperity,
      especially among the farmers, which began with the closing years of the
      nineteenth century and has continued with little reaction down to the
      present has removed many causes for agrarian discontent; but some of the
      old evils are left, and fresh grievances have come to the front.
      Experience taught the farmer one lesson which he has never forgotten: that
      whether prosperous or not, he can and must promote his welfare by
      organization. So it is that, as one association or group of associations
      declines, others arise. In some States, where the Grange has survived or
      has been reintroduced, it is once more the leading organ of the
      agricultural class. Elsewhere other organizations, sometimes confined to a
      single State, sometimes transcending state lines, hold the farmers'
      allegiance more or less firmly; and an attempt is now being made to unite
      all of these associations in an American Federation of Farmers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until recently these orders have devoted their 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
			energies principally to promoting the social and intellectual welfare of 
			the farmer and to business co&ouml;peration, sometimes on a large scale. 
			But, as soon as an organization has drawn into its ranks a considerable 
			proportion of the farmers of a State, especially in the West, the 
			temptation to use its power in the field of politics is almost 
			irresistible. At first, political activity is usually confined to 
			declarations in favor of measures believed to be in the interests of the 
			farmers as a class; but from this it is only a short step to the support 
			of candidates for office who are expected to work for those measures; and 
			thence the gradation is easy to actual nominations by the order or by a 
			farmers' convention which it has called into being. With direct primaries 
			in operation in most of the Western States, these movements no longer 
			culminate in the formation of the third party but in ambitious efforts to 
			capture the dominant party in the State. Thus in Wisconsin the president 
			of the state union of the American Society of Equity, a farmers' 
			organization which has heretofore been mainly interested in 
			co&ouml;perative buying and selling, was recently put forward by
      a "Farmers and Laborers Conference" as candidate for the nomination for
      governor on the Republican ticket and had the active support 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
			of the
      official organ of the society. In North Dakota, the Non-Partisan League, a
      farmers' organization avowedly political in its purposes, captured the
      Republican party a few years ago and now has complete control of the state
      government. The attempt of the League to seize the reins in Minnesota has
      been unsuccessful as yet, but Democratic and Republican managers are very
      much alarmed at its growing power. The organized farmers are once more a
      power in Western politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not, however, by votes cast and elections won or by the permanence
      of parties and organizations that the political results of the agrarian
      crusade are to be measured. The People's Party and its predecessors, with
      the farmers' organizations which supported them, professed to put measures
      before men and promulgated definite programs of legislation. Many of the
      proposals in these programs which were ridiculed at the time have long
      since passed beyond the stage of speculation and discussion. Regulation of
      railroad charges by national and state government, graduated income taxes,
      popular election of United States Senators, a parcels post, postal savings
      banks, and rural free delivery of mail are a few of these once visionary
      demands which have been satisfied by Federal law and constitutional
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
      amendment. Anti-trust legislation has been enacted to meet the demand for
      the curbing of monopolies; and the Federal land bank system which has
      recently gone into operation is practically the proposal of the
      Northwestern Alliance for government loans to farmers, with the greenback
      feature eliminated. Even the demand for greater volume and flexibility of
      currency has been met, though in ways quite different from those proposed
      by the farmers. &sup1;
    </p>

      <a id="footer_13-1" name="footer_13-1"></a> 
			&sup1; In July, 1894, when the People's Party was growing
     rapidly, the editor of the <i>Review of Reviews</i> declared:
     "Whether the Populist party is to prove itself capable of
     amalgamating a great national political organization or
     whether its work is to be done through a leavening of the
     old parties to a more or less extent with its doctrines and
     ideas, remains to be seen. At present its influence
     evidently is that of a leavening ingredient." The inclusion
     of the income tax in the revenue bill put through by the
     Democratic majority in Congress was described as "a mighty
     manifestation of the working of the Populist leaven"; and it
     was pointed out that "the Populist leaven in the direction
     of free silver at the ratio of 16 to 1 is working yet more
     deeply and ominously." The truth of the last assertion was
     demonstrated two years later.
    </p>
		</div>
    <p>
      In general it may be said that the farmers' organizations and parties
      stood for increased governmental activity; they scorned the economic and
      political doctrine of <i>laissez faire</i>; they believed that the people's
      governments could and should be used in many ways for promoting the
      welfare of the people, for assuring social justice, and for restoring 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
			or preserving economic as well as political equality. They were pioneers 
			in this field of social politics, but they did not work alone. Independent
      reformers, either singly or in groups, labor organizations and parties,
      and radicals everywhere co&ouml;perated with them. Both the old parties 
			were split into factions by this progressive movement; and in 1912 a
      Progressive party appeared on the scene and leaped to second place in its
      first election, only to vanish from the stage in 1916 when both the old
      parties were believed to have become progressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two most hopeful developments in American politics during recent years
      have been the progressive movement, with its program of social justice,
      and the growth of independent voting&mdash;both developments made possible
      in large part by the agrarian crusade. Perhaps the most significant
      contribution of the farmers' movement to American politics has been the
      training of the agricultural population to independent thought and action.
      No longer can a political party, regardless of its platform and
      candidates, count on the farmer vote as a certainty. The resolution of the
      Farmers' Alliance of Kansas "that we will no longer divide on party lines
      and will only cast our votes for candidates of the people, by the people,
      and for the people," was 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
			a declaration of a political independence which
      the farmers throughout the West have maintained and strengthened. Each
      successive revolt took additional voters from the ranks of the old
      parties; and, once these ties were severed, even though the wanderers
      might return, their allegiance could be retained only by a due regard for
      their interests and desires.

    <p class="noindent">
      <span class="smcap">The</span> 
			sources for the history of the agrarian crusade are to be found
      largely in contemporary newspapers, periodical articles, and the pamphlet
      proceedings of national and state organizations, which are too numerous to
      permit of their being listed here. The issues of such publications as the
      <i>Tribune Almanac</i>, the <i>Annual Cyclopedia</i> (1862-1903), and 
			Edward McPherson's <i>Handbook of Politics</i> (1868-1894) contain 
			platforms, election returns, and other useful material; and some of the 
			important documents for the Granger period are in volume X of the 
			<i>Documentary History of American Industrial Society</i> (1911), edited
			by John R. Commons.
    </p>
    <p>
      When each wave of the movement for agricultural organization was at its
      crest, enterprising publishers seized the opportunity to bring out books
      dealing with the troubles of the farmers, the proposed remedies, and the
      origin and growth of the orders. These works, hastily compiled for sale by
      agents, are partisan and unreliable, but they contain material not
      elsewhere available, and they help the reader to appreciate the spirit of
      the movement. Books of this sort for the Granger period include: Edward W.
      Martin's (<i>pseud</i>. of J.&nbsp;D. McCabe) <i>History of the Grange 
			Movement</i> (1874), Jonathan Periam's <i>The Groundswell</i> (1874), 
			Oliver H. Kelley's <i>Origin and Progress of the Order of</i> 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
			<i>the Patrons of Husbandry</i> (1875), and Ezra S. Carr's <i>The Patrons 
			of Husbandry on the Pacific Coast</i> (1875). Similar works induced by the 
			Alliance movement are: <i>History of the Farmers' Alliance, the 
			Agricultural Wheel</i>, etc., compiled and edited by the <i>St. Louis 
			Journal of Agriculture</i> (1890), <i>Labor and Capital, Containing an
      Account of the Various Organizations of Farmers, Planters, and 
			Mechanics</i> (1891), edited by Emory A. Allen, W. Scott Morgan's 
			<i>History of the Wheel and Alliance and the Impending Revolution</i> 
			(1891), H.&nbsp;R. Chamberlain's <i>The Farmers' Alliance</i> (1891), 
			<i>The Farmers' Alliance History and Agricultural Digest</i> (1891), 
			edited by N.&nbsp;A. Dunning, and N.&nbsp;B. Ashby's <i>The Riddle of 
			the Sphinx</i> (1890). Other contemporary books dealing with the evils of 
			which the farmers complained are: D.&nbsp;C. Cloud's <i>Monopolies and the 
			People</i> (1873), William A. Peffer's <i>The Farmer's Side</i> (1891),
      James B. Weaver's <i>A Call to Action</i> (1891), Charles H. Otken's 
			<i>The Ills of the South</i> (1894), Henry D. Lloyd's <i>Wealth against 
			Commonwealth</i> (1894), and William H. Harvey's <i>Coin's Financial 
			School</i> (1894).
    </p>
    <p>
      The nearest approach to a comprehensive account of the farmers' movement
      is contained in Fred E. Haynes's <i>Third Party Movements Since the Civil
      War, with Special Reference to Iowa</i> (1916). The first phase of the
      subject is treated by Solon J. Buck in <i>The Granger Movement</i> (1913),
      which contains an extensive bibliography. Frank L. McVey's <i>The Populist
      Movement</i> (1896) is valuable principally for its bibliography of
      contemporary material, especially newspapers and magazine articles. For
      accounts of agrarian activity in the individual States, the investigator
      turns to the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
			many state histories without much satisfaction. Nor can he find 
			monographic studies for more than a few States. A.&nbsp;E. Paine's <i>The
      Granger Movement in Illinois</i> (1904 University of Illinois Studies, 
			vol. I, No. 8) and Ellis B. Usher's <i>The Greenback Movement of 1875-1884 
			and Wisconsin's Part in It</i> (1911) practically exhaust the list. 
			Elizabeth N. Barr's <i>The Populist Uprising</i>, in volume II of William
			E. Connelley's <i>Standard History of Kansas</i> (1918), is a vivid and 
			sympathetic but uncritical narrative. Briefer articles have been written 
			by Melvin J. White, <i>Populism in Louisiana during the Nineties</i>, in 
			the <i>Mississippi Valley Historical Review</i> (June, 1918), and by 
			Ernest D. Stewart, <i>The Populist Party in Indiana</i> in the <i>Indiana 
			Magazine of History</i> (December, 1918). Biographical material on the 
			Populist leaders is also scant. For Donnelly there is Everett W. Fish's 
			<i>Donnelliana</i> (1892), a curious eulogy supplemented by "excerpts 
			from the wit, wisdom, poetry and eloquence" of the versatile hero; and a 
			life of General Weaver is soon to be issued by the State Historical 
			Society of Iowa. William J. Bryan's <i>The First Battle</i> (1896) and 
			numerous biographies of "the Commoner" treat of his connection with the 
			Populists and the campaign of 1896. Herbert Croly's <i>Marcus A. Hanna</i> 
			(1912) should also be consulted in this connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several of the general histories of the United States since the Civil War
      devote considerable space to various phases of the farmers' movement. The
      best in this respect are Charles A. Beard's <i>Contemporary American
      History</i> (1914) and Frederic L. Paxson's <i>The New Nation</i> (1915). 
			Harry Thurston Peck's <i>Twenty</i> 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
			<i>Years of the Republic, 1885-1905</i> (1906) contains an entertaining 
			account of Populism and the campaign of 1896. Pertinent chapters and 
			useful bibliographies will also be found in the following volumes of the 
			<i>American Nation</i>: William A. Dunning's <i>Reconstruction, Political 
			and Economic, 1865-1877</i> (1907), Edwin E. Sparks's <i>National 
			Development, 1877-1885</i> (1907), and David R. Dewey's <i>National 
			Problems, 1885-1897</i> (1907).

	 <h3>Introduction</h3>
</div>


<p>
Welcome to <span class="smcap">Project Gutenberg's</span> edition of
<i>The Agrarian Crusade</i> by Solon Justus Buck.  This book is part of the
<a href="#chroniclesAmerica">Chronicles of America</a> series produced by 
Yale University.</p>
<p>
The footnotes have been produced using the <span class="smcap">Project 
Gutenberg</span>&trade; standard.  Footnotes follow the paragraph in 
which they were mentioned.  Footnotes have been set in smaller print 
and have larger margins than regular text.  </p>
<p>
Our policy in displaying footnotes may cause them to appear on the page
following the one where the footnote appears in the paper book.  We have
therefore linked Index entries which refer to a footnote 
(denoted by <i>note</i>) to the footnote itself, and not the page number.  
</p>
<p>
Detailed notes describe problems or issues in transcribing a specific 
portion of the text.  Emendations are listed, and described, in the 
<i>Detailed Notes</i>, as well as other issues in transcribing the  
text.  
</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3>Detailed Notes Section:</h3>

<div id="notes">
<p><br /></p>
<h4>Cooperation vs. Co&ouml;peration:</h4>
<p>
   On <a href="#Page_026">Page 26</a>, <a href="#Page_113">Page 113</a>,
	 and <a href="#Page_119">Page 119</a>, cooperation is split between
	 two lines for spacing.  In those three instances where hyphenation
	 was called for, the umlat was not used in the book. When co&ouml;peration 
	 was not split between two lines for spacing, the book spelled the word with 
	 the umlat.  There are eighteen occurrences of co&ouml;peration.  There were 
	 also eighteen occurrences of co&ouml;perative, all which used the umlat.
	 Co&ouml;perate, co&ouml;perated, and co&ouml;perating were also used with 
	 the umlat.  Our assumption is that the umlat was omitted when 
	 co&ouml;peration was hyphenated for spacing, but in transcribing the word,
	 the hyphen is omitted and the umlat should be restored.  We have emended 
	 two cases in the index where the umlat was not used.  Therefore, we have 
	 consistently spelled all variations of co&ouml;perate throughout the book, 
	 including the index, and furthermore claim that we did not emend the text.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4> Chapter 9:</h4>
<p>
   On <a href="#Page_128">Page 128</a>, non-political is hyphenated and
	 split between two lines.  Later on the page, non-political is hyphenated
	 in the middle of a line.  There is one other use of non-political, on
	 page 43, used with a hyphen.  We retained the hyphen in transcribing the 
	 quote: <strong>Let the Alliance be a business organization for
   business purposes, and as such, necessarily secret, and as secret,
   necessarily non-political.</strong>
</p>
<p>
   On <a href="#Page_132">Page 132</a>, log-rolling is hyphenated and
	 split between two lines.  On <a href="#Page_159">Page 159</a>,
	 logrolling is spelled without the hyphen.  There are no other occurrences
	 of the word.  We removed the hyphen in transcribing the clause:
	 <strong>By the familiar practice of "logrolling"</strong>.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4> Chapter 10:</h4>
<p>
   On <a href="#Page_143">Page 143</a>, sub-treasury is hyphenated and
	 split between two lines.  There are four occurrences of sub-treasury
	 in the book, on pages 130-132 of Chapter 8.  There are no occurrences
	 of sub-treasury spelled without the hyphen.  We have transcribed
	 sub-treasury with the hyphen in the clause: with the 
	 <strong>sub-treasury</strong> system of loans.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4> Chapter 11:</h4>
<p>
   On <a href="#Page_165">Page 165</a>, storm-center is hyphenated and
	 split between two lines.  There are no other occurrences of the word
	 in the book. In the index, on page 211, storm-center is hyphenated in 
	 the middle of the line.  Because of this usage in the index, we 
	 retained the hyphen in the clause: Kansas became a 
	 <strong>storm-center</strong> ...

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.</p>

<p>
1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>
1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg&trade; mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg&trade; works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg&trade; name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg&trade; License when you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>
1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg&trade; work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>
1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg&trade;
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<p>
1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES: Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  <i>You agree that you have no remedies for negligence, strict
liability, breach of warranty or breach of contract except those
provided in Paragraph F3.  You agree that the Foundation, the 
trademark owner, and any distributor under this agreement will not be 
liable to you for actual, direct, indirect, consequential, punitive or 
incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such
damage. </i>
</p>

<p>
1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND: If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>
1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', <em>with no other 
warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to 
warranties of merchantibility or fitness for any purpose.</em>
</p>

<p>
1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</p>

<p>
1.F.6.  INDEMNITY: You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg&trade;
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg&trade; work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&trade;</p>

<p>
Project Gutenberg &trade; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg's&trade;
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&trade; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&trade; and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</p>

<p>
Project Gutenberg&trade; depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
<em>send donations</em> or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org.</p>

<p>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate.</p>

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic
works.</p>

<p>
Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg&trade;
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg&trade; eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p>
Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>
